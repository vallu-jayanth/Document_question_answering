This project has 3 main components. Eligible patients may choose to participate in any or all parts of the study: Questionnaires; Saliva Samples; Tumor Tissue.",
                "DetailedDescription": "This project will create the first state-wide data and biospecimen bank for men of African ancestry with prostate cancer. The sampling strategy and size of the study population ensure that the cohorts is representative, enhancing validity of studies based on this resource. In addition, there are no data on the role of smoking in African American prostate cancer. The approach to share the resource with Florida prostate cancer researchers is innovative and possible because the four annual prostate cancer symposiums organized by Moffitt has unified many Florida prostate cancer researchers who are now well connected and actively collaborating, as evidenced by publications and funded projects among participants."
