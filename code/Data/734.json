                "BriefSummary": "The proposed study will:\n\nestimate the prevalence of need for cancer screening and prevention in a population of 211 callers;\ndetermine whether cancer communication interventions delivered through 211 can increase use of breast, cervical and colon cancer screening, HPV vaccination, smoking cessation and adoption of smoke free home policies;\ndetermine how intensive an intervention is needed to bring about these changes; and\ndetermine whether the effectiveness of these interventions is enhanced when callers' basic needs have been addressed. Connecting these systems - 211, clinical and community cancer control programs and navigation services - should benefit disadvantaged Americans. The proposed study will evaluate the effects of this approach to eliminating cancer disparities.\n\nWe hypothesize that the proportion of 211 callers who obtain a needed cancer control service will:\n\ndiffer significantly by study group as follows: N > T > P > CONTROL;\nvary significantly across study groups based on the intervention dose callers receive; and\nvary significantly across study groups based on whether callers' original need was resolved, the extent of their basic needs, and their perception of life as manageable and predictable (i.e., sense of coherence).\n\n(Dissemination Aim): Determine costs to 211 and effects on quality of service by offering cancer control referrals.",
                "DetailedDescription": "For Americans living in poverty, cancer prevention and screening is a lower priority than meeting basic needs. When basic needs are addressed, the likelihood of engaging in these preventive behaviors increases. Strategies to eliminate cancer disparities in disadvantaged populations must recognize and address this fundamental challenge. We propose the first-ever cancer communication research partnership with United Way 2-1-1, a telephone information and referral system reaching millions of low-income and minority Americans every year and connecting them to locally available resources that can meet their basic needs. By proactively linking these callers to evidence-based cancer control services available for free in their community, cancer disparities could be reduced.\n\nThe proposed study will:\n\nestimate the prevalence of need for cancer screening and prevention in a population of 211 callers;\ndetermine whether cancer communication interventions delivered through 211 can increase use of breast, cervical and colon cancer screening, HPV vaccination, smoking cessation and adoption of smoke free home policies;\ndetermine how intensive an intervention is needed to bring about these changes; and\ndetermine whether the effectiveness of these interventions is enhanced when callers' basic needs have been addressed. Connecting these systems - 211, clinical and community cancer control programs and navigation services - should benefit disadvantaged Americans. The proposed study will evaluate the effects of this approach to eliminating cancer disparities.\n\nObjectives:\n\nStudy group assignment -- By random assignment they will then receive either:\n\nTailored Cancer Communication to help them act on the cancer control referral they received;\nA Cancer Control Navigator to help them overcome obstacles to obtaining needed cancer control services;\nCancer Control Phone Referral Only; or,\nNo intervention control\n\nThe study aims are to:\n\nEstimate the prevalence of need for cancer screening and prevention in a population of 211 callers and compare these rates to population data from Missouri and the U.S.\nEvaluate effects of Tailored Cancer Communication (T), Cancer Control Navigation (N), Cancer Control Phone Referral Only (P) on use of cancer control services in a randomized trial among 211 callers."
