The main research questions are:\n\nIs the GC-CCP network-based peer advocacy intervention superior to usual care (no intervention) in improving uptake of CC screening among alter participants, across urban/rural and public/private clinics?\nWhat are the mediators and moderators (among index, alter and network characteristics) of intervention effects on (a) alter CC screening; and (b) engagement in CC prevention advocacy among index participants?",
                "DetailedDescription": "This randomized controlled trial will evaluate Game Changers for Cervical Cancer Prevention (GC-CCP) for increasing cervical cancer (CC) screening among previously unscreened social network members. The trial will be conducted at 4 study clinics [2 public, 2 private-not-for-profit (PNFP), one each in an urban and rural location]. At each clinic, 40 women screened for CC in the past year will be enrolled in the RCT as index participants (n=160 index) and randomized to the intervention (in two groups of 10) or wait-list control. The intervention will consist of 7 weekly group sessions that focus on CC stigma reduction, sharing of CC screening experience with others, knowledge of CC facts and myths, and skills building for engagement in CC prevention advocacy with female social network members (alters). Each index will recruit up to three alters (n~440 alters) at baseline who have not screened for CC; these index and alter participants will be followed up at months 6 and 12."
