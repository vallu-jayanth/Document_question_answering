The Comprehensive Genomic Profiling of Colorectal Cancer Patients with Isolated Liver Metastases to Understand Response and Resistance to Cancer Therapy (COMPARISON) study aims to assess the disease course of CRC by collecting primary tumor and metastatic liver specimens following pre-operative chemotherapy. If relapse occurs following surgical resection of the liver, biopsies will also be done for molecular analysis. As a result, these samples can be analyzed for chemotherapy resistance mechanisms and therapeutic targets to determine potential clinical outcomes for this particular subset of CRC patients."
