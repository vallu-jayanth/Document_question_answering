                "BriefSummary": "This is a Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy, using objective response rate, of a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen followed by infusion of autologous Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) and high-dose aldesleukin in patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic biliary tract cancer. These are low-incidence cancers carry a poor prognosis. Participants will include patients with biliary tract cancers (BTC), including cholangiocarcinoma (both intrahepatic and extrahepatic) and gallbladder cancer, who are and are physically able to tolerate non-myeloablative chemotherapy and high-dose aldesleukin.",
                "DetailedDescription": "This Phase 2 study will be conducted in conjunction with companion protocol (Cell Harvest and Preparation to Support Adoptive Cell Therapy Clinical Protocols and Pre-Clinical Studies) as described below:\n\nCell Preparation:\n\nPatients with evaluable locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic biliary tract cancers who have lesions that can be resected or biopsied with minimum morbidity will undergo resection or biopsy of tumor. Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) will be obtained while enrolled on the companion protocol Cell Harvest and Preparation to Support Adoptive Cell Therapy Clinical Protocols and Pre-Clinical Studies. Separate tumor procurement(s) may be performed under the companion protocol to obtain TIL if initial tumor procurement(s) could not successfully generate TIL. The TIL will be grown and expanded for this trial according to standard operating procedures submitted in the IND. The TIL will be assessed for potency by interferon-gamma release.\n\nTreatment Phase:\n\nOnce cells exceed the potency requirement and are projected to exceed the minimum number specified in the COA, the patient will be registered on this study and receive the lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen consisting of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, followed by infusion of up to 2x1011 lymphocytes (minimum of 1x109 cells) and administration of high-dose intravenous aldesleukin. It is anticipated that TIL that meet the COA will not be achievable in approximately 20% of patients who undergo resection. These patients may undergo a second resection to grow TIL, if another suitable lesion exists. Approximately 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) after TIL administration, patients will undergo a complete tumor evaluation and evaluation of toxicity and immunologic parameters. Patients will receive one course of treatment. The start date of the course will be the start date of the chemotherapy; the end date will be the day of the first post-treatment evaluation. Patients may undergo a second treatment. Patients will receive no other experimental agents while on this protocol."
