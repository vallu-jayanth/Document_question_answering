In addition to the 4 visits, a phone contact with the patients every 6 months at years 2,3, 4 and 5 will be done by the investigator or one of his/her authorised representative or the CRO or during a routine visit to the investigator, to check the patient's survival status.\n\nTHE STUDY DURATION 72 MONTHS"
