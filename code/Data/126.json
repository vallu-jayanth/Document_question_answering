                "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to discover genetic changes associated with different cancers. With the information from this study the investigators hope to provide better ways to prevent, detect and treat many cancers.\n\nMany diseases can result from changes in a person's genetic material that causes cells to not work properly. Currently, researchers and doctors know some of the genetic changes that can cause disease, but they do not know all of the genetic changes that can cause disease.\n\nThis project is designed to identify genetic changes that can cause cancer in humans. Specimens will be collected from a scheduled diagnostic or routine (i.e. blood draw for counts) procedure and may include samples from the tissue itself (surgery), bone marrow, blood, saliva, urine, spinal fluid, sputum, joint fluid, seminal fluid, ascites (a fluid that fills up in the abdomen), and/or pleural fluid (fluid in the lung cavity), to either confirm the diagnosis of cancer or to help to decide how best to treat cancer or other illness. Additionally archived tissue may be analyzed. Samples may be stored for future use in later experiments. The Department of Pathology at Rhode Island Hospital will store the samples.\n\nInformation from the medical record, such as responses to treatments or family history of cancer, will be collected.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Complex, progressive, multigenic, somatic mutations of the genome are now widely accepted as the primary driving force in the evolution of cancer initiation, growth, metastasis and pharmacoresistance. Different types of tumors are associated with mutations in distinct sets of genes, and there is a pressing need for a sequencing-based method of analyzing panels of candidate genes that differ for each tumor type.\n\nTraditional approaches to sequence analysis employing capillary electrophoresis-based Sanger sequencing are widely used to guide therapy for patients with lung and colorectal cancer and for melanoma, sarcomas, leukemias and lymphomas. This technology is limited in throughput, scalability, speed, and resolution. The emerging technology such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) - holds a number of advantages over traditional methods, including the ability to fully sequence large numbers of genes in a single test and simultaneously detect deletions, insertions, copy number alterations, translocations, and exome-wide base substitutions in all known cancer-related genes.\n\nSequencing the whole genome is financially prohibitive for many potentially valuable applications. One alternative to whole genome methods is target enrichment, such as exome sequencing, which captures and sequences only protein coding regions. The exome represents 1-2% of the human genome; however contains the vast majority of disease causing alterations. In addition to exome sequencing, full-length transcriptome (mRNA) sequencing offers a fast and inexpensive alternative. It is an easier method to identify coding sequences and capture variants in genes that are expressed, as well as to generate additional information, such as gene expression level and splicing patterns.\n\nThe goal of this study is to investigate genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic alterations in human solid cancers and hematologic malignancies.\n\nPatients >18 y.o. diagnosed with cancer (including any solid tumor or hematologic malignancy) or patients who are undergoing a procedure for the diagnosis of a presumed cancer are eligible.\n\nThe research analysis will be performed by the department of pathology or the division of hematology oncology. The body/blood tissue analyzed will be from extra tissue/blood that is not needed for diagnosis or evaluation of the patient's cancer. All samples will be de-identified. Samples will be stored for an indefinite period of time or until all samples are utilized."
