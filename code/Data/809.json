                "BriefSummary": "Background:\n\nBreast cancer is the second most common cause of United States (U.S.) cancer deaths in women. Immunotherapy drugs use a person's immune system to fight cancer. Researchers want to see if a new combination of immunotherapy drugs can help treat breast cancer that has gone to places in the body outside of the breast (metastasized).\n\nObjective:\n\nTo learn if a new combination of immunotherapy drugs can shrink tumors in people with metastatic breast cancer.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults 18 and older who have been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, such as Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) or estrogen receptors (ER)-/progesterone receptors (PR)-/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+ Breast Cancer (HER2+BC)\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with:\n\nmedical history\n\nphysical exam\n\ndisease confirmation (or tumor biopsy)\n\ntumor scans (computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and/or bone scan)\n\nblood and urine tests\n\nelectrocardiogram (measures the hearts electrical activity)\n\nechocardiogram (creates images of the heart).\n\nParticipants will be assigned to 1 of 3 groups. The drugs they get will be based on the group they are in. Drugs are given in cycles. Each cycle = 3 weeks. Participants will be seen in clinic every 3 weeks, prior to the start of a new cycle. At each visit, participants will have an clinical exam, have blood drawn and will be asked about any side effects. They will repeat the screening tests during the study. New scans, like a computed tomography (CT) scan, will be done every 6 weeks to see if the treatment is working.\n\nAll participants will get Bavarian Nordic (BN)-Brachyury. It is 2 different vaccines - a prime and a boost. First the priming vaccines, called MVA-BN-Brachyury help to jump start the immune system. Next the boosting vaccines, called fowlpox virus (FPV)-Brachyury help to keep the immune system going. They are injected under the skin during different cycles.\n\nAll participants will get M7824 (also known as Bintrafusp alfa), which is an immunotherapy drug. Some participants will get a commonly used drug is HER2+ breast cancer called adotrastuzumab emtansine (also known as T-DM1DM1 or kadcyla). For both, a needle is inserted into a vein to give the drugs slowly.\n\nSome participants will take Entinostat weekly by mouth. It is in tablet form. Participants will keep a pill diary.\n\nParticipants will continue on their assigned treatment until their cancer grows, they develop side effects or want to stop treatment. About 28 days after treatment ends, participants will have a follow-up visit or a telephone call. Then they will be contacted every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for 1 year. They may have more tumor scans or continue treatment.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Background:\n\nCurrent greater than or equal to 2nd line treatments for metastatic breast cancer provide modest response rates, and modest improvement in progression-free survival but no treatments are curative.\nBavarian-Nordic (BN)-Brachyury vaccine is a recombinant poxvirus vaccine against the transcription factor brachyury, which plays an important role in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer. A recently completed phase 1 study of BN-Brachyury vaccine showed the vaccine was well tolerated and generated an immune response.\nM7824 (Bintrafusp alfa) is a novel bifunctional fusion protein composed of a monoclonal antibody against human programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) fused to the soluble extracellular domain of human transforming growth factor (TGF)-Beta receptor II (TGF-BetaRII(241-R2), which functions as a TGF-Beta trap.\nAdo-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1 or Kadcyla) is an antibody drug conjugate used in second- and third- line treatment of metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2+) breast cancer (HER2+BC). T-DM1 activates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), dendritic cell maturation, increases tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), increased PD-L1 expression, and increased immunomodulatory cytokines.\nEntinostat is a class 1 histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) which suppresses tumor initiating cells, regulatory T-cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), as well as enhances cytotoxic T-cell mediated lysis, direct natural killer (NK) lysis, NK cell activation, increases PD-L1 expression and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In addition, entinostat may also be able to overcome HER2 resistance.\n\nWe propose a Phase 1b trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the stepwise combination of the BN-Brachyury vaccine, M7824, T-DM1 and entinostat in metastatic breast cancer.\n\nArm 1 - Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC); M7824 + BN-Brachyury\nArm 2 - estrogen receptors (ER)-/progesterone receptors (PR-)/HER2+ Breast Cancer; M7824 + BN-Brachyury + T-DM1\nArm 3 - ER-/PR-/HER2+ Breast Cancer; M7824 + BN-Brachyury + T-DM1+ Entinostat\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\nArms 1-3: Overall response rate (overall response rate (ORR); partial response (PR)+complete response (CR)\nArms 1-3: Safety for each of the three combinations of agents explored in the arms\n\nEligibility:\n\nSelected Inclusion Criteria\n\nHistologically confirmed metastatic breast cancer with appropriate immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing by a certified lab:\n\nFor Arm 1: Triple negative breast cancer. Hormone receptor negative is defined by estrogen receptor < 10% and progesterone receptor < 10%. HER2 negative breast cancer is defined as HER2 per IHC 0 or 1+ or 2+ with negative fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).\nFor Arms 2 and 3: Hormone receptor negative, HER2+ breast cancer as defined by estrogen receptor < 10% and progesterone receptor < 10%. HER2 positive as per IHC 3+ or 2+ with positive FISH.\n\nPrior treatment:\n\nFor Arm 1: greater than or equal to 1 prior therapy in the metastatic setting. Patients with known PD-L1 positive tumors must have received prior treatment with atezolizumab + nab-paclitaxel. Patients with ER 1-9% must have received treatment with at least two lines of endocrine treatment (selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM), AI, fulvestrant) with one prior treatment including a cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)/6 inhibitor + endocrine therapy for their metastatic cancer and should be considered endocrine therapy resistant.\nFor Arms 2 and 3: greater than or equal to 1 prior treatment in the metastatic setting with a taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel), herceptin and pertuzumab.\nFemales or males greater than or equal to 18 years old\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0 or 1\nMeasurable metastatic disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.\nFor Cohort 3, Arms 2 and 3: At least one biopsiable lesion and willingness to undergo up to three research biopsies.\nAdequate hematopoietic, hepatic, renal and cardiac (ejection fraction (EF) greater than or equal to 50%) function.\n\nSelected Exclusion Criteria\n\nPatients who have received chemotherapy, including trastuzumab and pertuzumab in the previous 3 weeks; other investigational agents within 4 weeks or a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 antibody within 4 weeks prior to study enrollment; radiotherapy less than or equal to 4 weeks of study entry.\nSymptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases and leptomeningeal disease are excluded but treated brain metastases (no radiotherapy within 6 weeks) or asymptomatic brain metastasis are allowed.\nHistory of invasive malignancy less than or equal to 3 years prior to enrollment.\nHistory of congestive heart failure (CHF) as defined as New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3 or 4 or hospitalization for CHF (any NYHA class) within 6 months of trial start.\nConcurrent use of chronic systemic steroids except for physiologic systemic steroids for replacement defined as 10mg of prednisone or an equivalent dose.\n\nDesign:\n\nThis study contains three separate, single arm phase 1b trials.\n\nArm 1 will evaluate M7824 and BN-Brachyury in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).\nIf this doublet is determined to have acceptable toxicity (0-1 dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of the first 6 patients), up to 19 patients will be enrolled on Arm 2 in which BN-Brachyury, M7824 and T-DM1 will be evaluated in patients with advanced HR-/HER2+ BC with disease progression after treatment with docetaxel (THP) or intolerance to THP.\nIf this triplet is determined to have acceptable toxicity (0-1 DLTs of the first 6 patients), 19 patients will be enrolled on Arm 3 in which BN-Brachyury, entinostat, M7824 and T-DM1 will be evaluated in patients with advanced HR-/HER2+ BC with disease progression after treatment with THP or intolerance to THP.\nUp to 51 evaluable patients will be recruited for this study, with an accrual ceiling set at 65 patients.\n\nTrial Drugs\n\nBN-Brachyury vaccine every 3 weeks until cycle 9, then every 12 weeks:\n\nRecombinant MVA-BN-Brachyury (R2PD): 4 injections of vaccines with 1 given subcutaneous (SC) in each extremity on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2. Each injection of MVA-BN-Brachyury consists of 2.0 x 10(8) infectious units (Inf.U).\nRecombinant fowlpox virus (FPV)-Brachyury: 1 injection given SC in one extremity on Day 1 of Cycles 3 and beyond.
