The primary objective is to measure the thioredoxin reductase activity in blood in staged(\u2160~\u2162A) non-small lung cancers, to study the warning relapse ability of thioredoxin reductase in blood. The secondary objective is to compare the warning relapse activity of blood thioredoxin reductase activity with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in subjects who received surgery. Blood will be collected in subjects before surgery, 5 days after surgery, and every 3 months after surgery till 2 years, then every 6 months till 3 years, or collect blood till tumor relapse for the subjects at stage \u2160A and low risk \u2160B. Blood will be collected before surgery, 5 days after surgery, before adjuvant chemotherapy, after 2 circles of all adjuvant chemotherapy, then every 3 months after adjuvant chemotherapy till 2 years, and every 6 months till 3 years, or collect blood till tumor relapse for the subjects of high risk \u2160B~\u2162A, evaluation CT results every time collect blood samples."
