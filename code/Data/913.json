                "BriefSummary": "What Matters Most is a study that aims to determine how best to help women of lower socioeconomic status make high-quality decisions about early stage breast cancer treatments. What Matters Most will be comparing two decision aids used in the clinic visit to usual care (what normally happens in the clinic). The first decision aid (Option Grid) presents evidence-based information about lumpectomy and mastectomy in a tabular format using text only. The second decision aid (Picture Option Grid) presents evidence-based information about lumpectomy and mastectomy using pictures, pictographs and simplified text. What Matters Most aims to show that the interventions can reduce disparities in decision-making and treatment choice between women of high and low SES.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Background and Significance\n\nBreast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women. Despite improvements in survival, women of low socioeconomic status (SES) diagnosed with early stage breast cancer:\n\nContinue to experience poorer doctor-patient communication, lower satisfaction with surgery and decision making, and higher decision regret compared to women of higher SES;\nOften play a passive role in decision making;\nAre less likely to undergo breast-conserving surgery (BCS);\nAre less likely to receive optimal care.\n\nThose differences are disparities that predominantly affect women of low SES with early stage breast cancer, irrespective of race or ethnicity. For early stage breast cancer, low SES is a stronger predictor of poorer outcomes, treatment received and death, than race or ethnicity. The investigators define low SES as a lower income, lower educational attainment, and uninsured or state-insured status\n\nAlthough BCS is the recommended treatment for early stage breast cancer (stages I to IIIA), research confirms equivalent survival between mastectomy and BCS. Both options are offered yet have distinct harms and benefits, valued differently by patients. The patient and stakeholder partners involved in this study have emphasized the critical importance of supporting women in making high quality breast cancer surgery decisions (good knowledge and alignment between the patient's choice, values and priorities) irrespective of SES and health literacy. Yet, research shows that women of low SES are not usually involved in an informed, patient-centered dialogue about surgery choice. There is no evidence that women of low SES have distinct preferences that explain a lower uptake of BCS and limited engagement in decision making. Further, communication strategies are not typically adapted to women of low SES and low health literacy. Most decision aids for breast cancer have been designed for highly literate audiences, with poor accessibility and readability. Simpler, shorter decision aids delivered in the clinical encounter (encounter decision aids) may be more beneficial to underserved patients, and could reduce disparities. It is critical to determine how to effectively support women of low SES in making informed breast cancer surgery choices.\n\nStudy Aims\n\nFirst, the investigators will assess the comparative effectiveness of two effective encounter decision aids (Option Grid and Picture Option Grid) against usual care on decision quality (primary outcome), shared decision making, treatment choice and other secondary outcomes across socioeconomic strata (Aim 1). Second, the investigators aim to explore the effect of the Picture Option Grid on disparities in decision making (decision quality, knowledge, and shared decision making), treatment choice, as well as mediation and moderation effects (Aim 2). Third, in order to maximize the implementation potential, the investigators will explore strategies that promote the encounter decision aids' sustained use and dissemination using a theoretical implementation model (Aim 3).\n\nStudy Description\n\nThe investigators will conduct a three-arm, multi-site randomized controlled superiority trial with stratification by SES (Aims 1 and 2) and randomization at the clinician level. One thousand, one hundred patients (half of higher SES and half of lower SES) will be recruited from five large cancer centers. In preparation for the trial (Year 01), the investigators will conduct semi-structured interviews with women of low SES who have completed treatment for early stage breast cancer to adapt the \"What Matters Most to You\" subscale of the Decision Quality Instrument (DQI) for women of low SES. Lastly, the investigators will use interviews, field-notes, and observations to explore strategies that promote the interventions' sustained use and dissemination using the Normalization Process Theory (Aim 3). Community-Based Participatory Research will be used throughout the trial (with continuous patient and stakeholder involvement).\n\nWomen 18 years and older with a confirmed diagnosis of early stage breast cancer (I to IIIA) from both higher and lower SES will be included in the trial, provided they have a basic command of English, Spanish, or Mandarin. About 367 patients will be recruited per arm.\n\nBoth interventions have been developed, tested, and shown to be effective. The Option Grid (intervention 1) is a one-page evidence-based summary of available options presented in a tabular format, listing the trade-offs that patients normally consider when making breast cancer surgery decisions. The Picture Option Grid (intervention 2) uses the same evidence and tabular layout, but it is tailored to women of lower SES and low health literacy and includes simple text and images. Because decision aids are not routinely available in real world settings, usual care is a coherent and legitimate comparator. It will include the provision of usual information resources about breast cancer but will exclude the provision of other decision aids.\n\nSecondary outcome measures will include treatment choice, the validated 3-item CollaboRATE measure of shared decision-making (SDM), Chew's validated one-item health literacy screening question, PROMIS, an 8-item validated anxiety short form, EQ-5D-5L, a validated, standardized 6-item quality of life measure, and four items from COST, a validated financial toxicity measure. Participants will also be asked to estimate their out-of-pocket expenses over the past month. All measures will be available in English, Spanish, and Mandarin. Observer OPTION5 will be used to rate the level of shared decision making in the clinical encounter.\n\nA regression framework (logistic regression, linear regression, mixed effect regression models, generalized estimating equations) and mediation analyses will be used in the analysis. The investigators will also use multiple informants analysis to measure and examine SES and multiple imputation to manage missing data. Heterogeneity of treatment effects analyses for SES, age, ethnicity, race, literacy, language, and study site will be performed. The investigators will also use the recordings of surgical consultations to analyze the conversations about costs and treatment recommendations made by providers."

Knowledge is five questions that results in a score from 0 to 5 with higher numbers indicating higher knowledge. Decision process is a measure how much shared decision making process occurred, based on patient-report. It is a seven-item scale with higher numbers indicating higher shared decision process. For the concordance score, patients rated their goals and concerns on an 11-point importance scale from 0 (not important at all) to 10 (extremely important). They also indicated which surgery they intended to have at T2. A concordance summary score (0-100%) indicated the percentage of patients who received a treatment that matched their stated preference at T2 (lumpectomy vs mastectomy).",

Decision process is a measure how much shared decision making process occurred, based on patient-report. It is a seven-item scale with higher numbers indicating higher shared decision process. For the concordance score, patients rated their goals and concerns on an 11-point importance scale from 0 (not important at all) to 10 (extremely important). They also indicated which surgery they intended to have at T2. A concordance summary score (0-100%) indicated the percentage of patients who received a treatment that matched their stated preference.",

Decision quality is measured through three constructs: knowledge, decision process, and concordance. Knowledge is five questions that results in a score from 0 to 5 with higher numbers indicating higher knowledge. Decision process is a measure how much shared decision making process occurred, based on patient-report. It is a seven-item scale from 0 to 7 with higher numbers indicating higher shared decision process. For the concordance score, patients rated their goals and concerns on an 11-point importance scale from 0 (not important at all) to 10 (extremely important). They also indicated which surgery they intended to have at T2. A concordance score indicated the percentage of patients who received a treatment that matched their stated preference.",

Decision process is a measure how much shared decision making process occurred, based on patient-report. It is a seven-item scale with higher numbers indicating higher shared decision process. For the concordance score, patients rated their goals and concerns on an 11-point importance scale from 0 (not important at all) to 10 (extremely important). They also indicated which surgery they intended to have at T2. A concordance summary score (0-100%) indicated the percentage of patients who received a treatment that matched their stated preference at T2 (lumpectomy vs mastectomy).",
