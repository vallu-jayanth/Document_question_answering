                "DetailedDescription": "OBJECTIVES:\n\nDetermine the progression-free and overall survival of patients with selected stage IIIB or stage IV bronchoalveolar carcinoma treated with GVAX lung cancer vaccine.\nDetermine the response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed and complete and partial) in patients treated with this vaccine.\nDetermine the frequency and severity of toxic effects of this vaccine in these patients.\nDetermine the functional status of patients treated with this vaccine.\nCorrelate systemic biologic activity (i.e., antigen-specific antitumor and systemic cytokine responses) with clinical outcome in patients treated with this vaccine.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior systemic cancer therapy for bronchoalveolar carcinoma (BAC) (yes vs no) and pattern of BAC (diffuse vs nodular).\n\nAfter successful vaccine manufacturing from tumor tissue procured, patients receive GVAX lung cancer vaccine intradermally (ID) (6-7 injections per vaccination) on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 for a total of 5 vaccinations. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\nQuality of life is assessed at baseline and at weeks 9, 13, and 21.\n\nPatients are followed at 4 weeks, every 8 weeks for 1 year, and then every 12 weeks for 2 years.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 117 patients (67 previously untreated and 50 previously treated) will be accrued for this study."
