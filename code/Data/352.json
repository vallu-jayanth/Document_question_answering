                "DetailedDescription": "The dysfunction and reduced proliferation of peripheral immune cells including CD8 T and NK cells have been observed in both aging and cancer patients, thereby challenging the immune cell therapy in these subjects. Therefore, we evaluated the growth of these lymphocytes in elderly patients with several types of cancer and the correlation of peripheral blood (PB) indexes to the expansions. This is a retrospective study that included 60 cancer patients who underwent autologous NK cell and CD8 T cell therapy between January 2016 and December 2021. By optimizing the antiviral and tumor surveillance ability of both NK cells and CTLs through serial steps from isolation and expansion, followed by re-infusion of these activated cells back to the patient body, AIET has become a promising, cutting-edge method in detecting and eliminating cancer cells. The study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of 60 cancer patientsreceiving AIET."
