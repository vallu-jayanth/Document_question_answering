                "DetailedDescription": "As the investigators understanding of how ER-positive breast cancer (a type of cancer in which the cells need the hormone estrogen to grow) improves, more treatment decisions are being tailored to an individual's unique genetic makeup. National medical guidelines now include the routine use of tumor profiling tests, like the Prosigna\u00ae assay, which look at the gene activity of a person's cancer cells to determine the likely outcome or course of a disease (prognosis) and predict the benefit of chemotherapy or endocrine therapy after breast surgery.\n\nCurrently, the Prosigna\u00ae assay (also called PAM-50) is FDA approved as a tool that physicians can use to help make decisions about a patient's treatment after their breast surgery. In these cases, physicians run this test using tumor tissue from a patient's breast surgery. However, the Prosigna\u00ae assay is not approved for use preoperatively, or before surgery.\n\nPrevious studies showed that the Prosigna\u00ae assay was able to identify tumor types that were more likely to benefit from treatment before surgery (whether it's hormonal therapy or chemotherapy). In this study, the investigators will use tumor tissue from the participant's biopsy to run the Prosigna\u00ae assay. The test may give both the participant and the investigators more information about the best possible treatment option for the participant before surgery.\n\nThis study is being done to determine how Prosigna\u00ae assay results may affect the physician's choice of treatment before surgery and how well patients understand the test and its implications."
