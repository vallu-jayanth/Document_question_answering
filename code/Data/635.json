Results from the assay can be used to guide the intra-operative or post-operative decision to remove additional lymph nodes and to aid in patient staging. An assay positive + or ++ result indicates the presence of metastasis (> 0.2 mm). An assay positive ++ result predicts the presence of macrometastasis (> 2 mm).\n\nPost-operative histological evaluation of permanent sections of the tissue specimen, in accordance with usual diagnostic practice and using the Sysmex lymph node cutting scheme, is required.",
