Controlling the timelines in a care program seems crucial to improve prognosis of lung cancer.\n\nThe project aims to evaluate the impact of a coordinating nurse (CN) in a personalized care program for patients of thoracic oncology.",
                "DetailedDescription": "New strategies therapeutics result in a longer survival rate. However their side effects affect the patient's quality of life. Even if these side effects are ambulatory manageable, they require to be treated promptly and tends to increase the active list of patients of the thoracic oncology.\n\nDue to the alteration in the care provided to lung cancer patient, there is a need to coordinate the available means, inside and outside the hospital, to improve the quality of care and the quality of life of the patient.\n\nEvery patient of the thoracic oncology department receives a personalized care program as a routine practice. In this study, a coordinating nurse (CN) will be added to the personalized care program. Patients newly diagnosed with a lung cancer will be randomized either in the group with a CN or in the group without a CN.\n\nThe study will last one year maximum for each participant. Their quality of life, their satisfaction of the quality of the personalized care program - and their general practitioner's satisfaction - will be evaluated throughout the study."
