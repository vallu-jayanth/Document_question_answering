Information will be used to examine risk patterns a) seperately by anatomic subsite; b) among patients with gallbladder cancer vs. controls undergoing cholecystectomy for gallstones; c) among the patients with bile duct cancer vs. Hospital controls without cancer who undergo surgery for removal of bile duct stones. We will also attempt to ascertain reasons for cancer who undergo surgery for removal of bile duct stones. We will also attempt to ascertain reasons for the rising incidence of biliary tract cancers in Shanghai. Serum collected from all subjects will be analyzed for estrogens and other hormones, vitamins C and E, cholesterol, and bacterial antibodies (including salmonella typhi, paratyphi, and escherischia coli). Bile fluid will be cultured for aerobic bacteria, and gallstones analyzed for color, cholesterol, and evidence of bacteria infection. A major challenge in biliary tract cancer research is to determine how cancer risk factors differ from those for gallstones or biliary duct stone disease, since many people have gallstones (or biliary duct stones) but few develop cancer....",
