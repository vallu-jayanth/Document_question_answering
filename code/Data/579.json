Patients will be enrolled into two cohorts, one for individuals who meet current NCCN testing guidelines, and one for individuals who do not meet current NCCN guidelines.\n\nThe main goal of this Registry is to assess whether nationally developed guidelines used to select patients for hereditary testing are adequate to identify all patients with prostate cancer who may benefit from testing. Patients will completed a post-test survey regarding their testing experience and clinicians will be asked to provide additional medical records review information via the Clinician Report Form."
