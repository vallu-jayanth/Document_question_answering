The investigators aim to understand if prompt and effective coordination of care provided by Oncology Nurse Navigation (ONN) service will reduce the number of avoidable, unplanned ED visits and hospitalizations, as well as adding measurable value to cancer care, and improve patient overall survival.",

Upon accrual, patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive standard of care plus ONN service (n = 107) or standard of care only (without ONN service; n = 107). Patients in both arms will be assessed for acute care utilization and overall survival (OS) rate at 6 months. Anticipated accrual period will be 30 months."
