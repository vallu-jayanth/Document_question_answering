                "BriefSummary": "This research study is evaluating whether contrast enhanced mammography can be used as an alternative to breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for cancer screening",
                "DetailedDescription": "Mammography is the main way to help find breast cancers early so they can be treated. Unfortunately, mammography does not work as well in women who have dense breast tissue or who are at high-risk for breast cancer. In these women, breast MRI is also used to help find breast cancers.\n\nContrast enhanced mammography is a new type of mammogram. It uses contrast material combined with the mammogram to highlight areas that might be breast cancer and that could be missed on the mammogram alone. This is similar to breast MRI.\n\nFor this study, participants who are already getting a breast biopsy will have a contrast enhanced mammogram and a breast MRI before the biopsy. The participant's contrast enhanced mammogram and breast MRI images will then be included within a large collection of images. Radiologists will compare the images to see if the contrast enhanced mammograms and the breast MRI find the same number of breast cancers. If the investigators find they perform similarly, then contrast mammography may be used to aid in breast cancer screening in the future."
