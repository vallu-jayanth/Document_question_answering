The main questions the investigators aim to answer are:\n\nWill the religiously tailored and culturally appropriate intervention program improve participants' knowledge and acceptance of cervical cancer prevention?\nIs the intervention program feasible to conduct and acceptable to participants?\n\nParticipants will be asked to:\n\nAttend focus group sessions to provide input on the development of educational materials.\nComplete pre- and post-intervention surveys to measure changes in knowledge and acceptance of cervical cancer prevention.\nEngage in the intervention program, which includes education and experiential practice/communication skills training.\nProvide feedback through satisfaction surveys. Researchers will compare participant outcomes before and after the intervention to assess its effectiveness. Additionally, the program's feasibility and acceptability will be evaluated based on enrollment rates, successful implementation, participant engagement, retention, and satisfaction.",
                "DetailedDescription": "This project involves creating special educational materials for Muslim women to learn about cervical cancer prevention. The investigators will engage in discussions with 10 Muslim women during dedicated group sessions to ensure the suitability of the materials. They will also seek input from Muslim religious leaders. Subsequently, they will conduct surveys before and after the program to assess the effectiveness of the materials in facilitating women's learning and comprehension of cervical cancer prevention. To determine its efficacy and acceptability, the investigators will implement the program with an additional 20 women and gather their feedback. The goal of this project is to promote the health and well-being of Muslim women by providing them with culturally and religiously sensitive information regarding cervical cancer prevention."

Before the intervention, participants will complete a pre-intervention survey to assess their knowledge and acceptance of cervical cancer prevention. Following the intervention, participants will undergo the post-intervention survey to measure any changes in their knowledge and acceptance levels. By utilizing this survey-based approach, the investigators aim to gather valuable data on the impact of the intervention and determine its potential effectiveness in improving participants' understanding and engagement with cervical cancer prevention activities.",
