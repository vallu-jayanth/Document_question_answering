                "BriefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test the imaging and diagnostic ability of [68Ga]-NOTA-SGC8 PET/MR in bladder cancer patients with different stages. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\nTumor specific lighting ability of [68Ga]-NOTA-SGC8 in bladder cancer patients with different stages.\nThe safety of [68Ga]-NOTA-SGC8. Participants will be irrigated with [68Ga]-NOTA-SGC8 into the bladder for tumor imaging under PET/MR. The imaging performance of [68Ga]-NOTA-SGC8 on different stages of bladder tumors will be systematically evaluated by combining with pathological sections of patients. Urine accumulation and radioactivity distribution of [68Ga]-NOTA-SGC8 will be measured. The adverse events will be recorded.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Participants will be irrigated with [68Ga]-NOTA-SGC8 intravesically, with 0.05mCi/kg per person per time according to body weight, no more than 5mCi. The participants will be instructed to urinate cleanly before irrigation, and then irrigated [68Ga]-NOTA-SGC8 into the bladder via catheter for 30 minutes to make full contact between the injection and tumor. After 30 minutes, the injection will be withdrawn and 300ml normal saline will be injected into the bladder to maintain the shape of the bladder.\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy of [68Ga]-NOTA-SGC8 in imaging bladder tumors, the following indexes will be measured: specific imaging of the tumor area; specific imaging of its target PTK7 receptor protein; distribution in major organs; PET/MR imaging after administration; the absorbed dose of internal radiation based on the reference human hormone model using OLINDA software.\n\nTumor tissues of patients will be collected, and pathological sections of relevant patients will be analyzed after surgery. Immunohistochemistry will be used to verify the expression of PTK7 receptor in corresponding tumors. The association between PTK7 receptor protein and tumor malignancy, invasion, and stage will be evaluated by molecular imaging results.\n\nAll adverse events will be recorded within 24 hours after the administration of [68Ga]-NOTA-SGC8. Serious adverse events will be recorded for all subjects within 24 hours to 5 days after intravesical infusion. Blood and urine samples will be collected and the concentration of 68Ga-NOTA-SGC8 in the blood and urine will be analyzed."
