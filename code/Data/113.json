The study will promote standard of care that is endorsed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). This project is supported both operationally and by an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) R18 grant.\n\nThis project will leverage Decision Precision, a validated Web-based tool for LDCT SDM developed at the Veterans Health Administration, as well as an initial version of Decision Precision+, an EHR-integrated version of the tool which can be accessed directly in the EHR and auto-populate relevant patient data in the tool instead of requiring manual data entry.\n\nThis study will be an 18-month interrupted time series study conducted at the University of Utah Health primary care clinics."

In particular, it is anticipated that the guidelines may update during the study whereby the minimum age is reduced to 50 (from 55) and the minimum smoking history is reduced to 20 years (from 30). In the event that the USPSTF guidelines change, the intervention will be updated to match the change to the guidelines.
