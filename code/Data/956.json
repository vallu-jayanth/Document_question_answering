                "DetailedDescription": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the prevalence of complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) practices among adult women who are enrolled in the Risk Assessment Clinic at the National Naval Medical Center Breast Care Center and are found to be at increased risk for developing breast cancer. II. Correlate the use of CAM with individual risk for breast cancer. III. Define the types of CAM practices used by this study population. IV. Identify reasons why this study population is using CAM.\n\nOUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine practices (enteral/parenteral vs psychologic/neurologic). Patients complete a Personal Risk Assessment form, pre-test/post-test knowledge questionnaires, and a survey questionnaire.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 102 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately 2 years."
