By histopathological examination, lesions identified during cystoscopy will be confirmed as malignant or non-malignant by histological examination.",

The participants will undergo a cystoscopy within 30 days of enrollment. For confirmation of the diagnosis and stage of the tumor, representative histopathology slides from TURBT (Transurethral Resection of Bladder Tumors) may be retrieved and examined by the central pathology laboratory."
