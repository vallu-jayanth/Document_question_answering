                "BriefSummary": "This study will examine the potential for an Interactive Cancer Communication System (ICCS) to impact not only psychosocial outcomes such as quality of life but also length of survival in an advanced stage lung cancer population. Two hypotheses will be tested: the Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System- Lung Cancer (CHESS- LC) will significantly improve patient quality of life and length of overall survival as compared to a usual care control group.",
                "DetailedDescription": "The prognosis for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer patients remains poor despite recent advances in anti-cancer therapies. A lung cancer diagnosis often inflicts fear, despair, and hopelessness on patients and loved ones. For lung cancer patients in particular, a population where palliation rather than cure is often the focus, interventions addressing communication about various types of suffering are crucial to quality of life (QOL). Our Center has done extensive research testing CHESS (Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System), a non-commercial, web-based information and support system. The recent Clinician Integration Project tested the impact of CHESS versus an Internet only Control group on QOL for caregivers of advanced stage lung cancer patients. This study yielded an unanticipated finding that CHESS may have a survival benefit for patients as one year survival was significantly increased in the CHESS group (50%) compared to Internet (34.2%). As this project did not focus on patient outcomes, follow-up with a well-formulated study designed and powered to address specific hypotheses of the nature of this effect is critical. The proposed study will specifically test QOL and survival effects of CHESS on lung cancer patients. Using sites in Wisconsin, Connecticut,Houston, and Chicago, we will randomly assign 376 advanced lung cancer patients to two study arms: a patient control group receiving Usual Care (including access to a computer and Internet) and a group given access to the CHESS website. Patients may invite a caregiver to participate. Patients will be followed for 18 months or until patient death."
