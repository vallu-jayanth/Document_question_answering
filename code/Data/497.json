                "BriefSummary": "Objectives:\n\nThis protocol addresses the first phase of a larger project funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to help heavy smokers make informed decisions about lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (CT). A separate IRB protocol will be submitted for the larger, comparative study. In this initial development phase, our prototype patient decision aid will be updated to reflect current guidelines about lung cancer screening. The updated aid will then be pilot-tested in a new sample of patients. In addition, several of the study measures will be refined and further developed in preparation for the larger study.\n\nThe specific aims of the measures and decision aid development phase of this project are as follows:\n\nUpdate the aid to reflect current screening guidelines and refine the aid via cognitive testing with patients/smokers; and pilot test the updated aid for acceptability with patients/smokers.\n\nModify our current measure of lung cancer knowledge, conduct cognitive testing of the new measure with patients/smokers, and evaluate the reliability of the new measure in a sample patients/smokers.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Cognitive and Pilot Testing:\n\nIf you agree to take part in this study, you will take part in an interview with a member of the research staff. The interviewer will take notes of your responses. First, you will be asked some questions about you, like your age, sex, race, and education level. Then you will be asked to look at some educational materials about lung cancer screening. These could be written information, animations, graphics, videos, or questionnaires. You may be asked questions about:\n\nLung cancer and lung cancer screening\nThe length of the materials\nThe balance of the information found in the materials\n\nThe study interview will take place in person at MD Anderson and will take between 1 and 1 \u00bd hours.\n\nYour participation on this study will be over once the interview is complete.\n\nThis is an investigational study.\n\nUp to 50 participants will be enrolled in this part of the study. All will take part at MD Anderson, UTMB, the Galveston community, or tobacco-related community events.\n\nMeasures Reliability Study:\n\nIf you agree to take part in this study, you will complete a questionnaire 2 times. The questionnaire will ask about:\n\nLung cancer\nLung cancer screening\nMaking decisions about screening\nYour age, race, gender, and level of education\n\nYou will complete the first questionnaire in person. It will take about 20 minutes to fill out. Then, about 1 month later, you will be asked to fill out the questionnaire again.\n\nThe second time you can come in person, or fill out the questionnaire by mail or telephone. Your participation will be over when the second questionnaire is complete.\n\nThis is an investigational study.\n\nUp to 150 participants will be enrolled in this part of the study. All will take part at MD Anderson, UTMB, the Galveston community, or tobacco-related community events."
