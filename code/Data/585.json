Follow-up phone call intervention regarding FRP may improve recruitment of cancer patients to cancer therapeutic clinical trials.",
                "DetailedDescription": "There are limited financial models that address the economic hardship associated with clinical research participation and how it might restrict clinical research access. The Lazarex Foundation offers a financial reimbursement program (FRP) to help patients and caregivers cover the out-of-pocket costs associated with clinical trial participation for almost ten years.\n\niMPACT is a pilot study to assess the overall feasibility of conducting a multi-center trial of the Lazarex sliding scale FRP among sociodemographically diverse patients of all cancer types enrolling/potentially enrolling in therapeutic clinical trials (TCTs). The study will formalize informing patients or parents/legal guardians of patients about the Lazarex sliding-scale FRP in order to evaluate whether operationalizing intensive follow-up about the Lazarex FRP improves recruitment to cancer TCTs.\n\nAll patients or parents/legal guardians of patients will be offered information about the FRP at initial time of TCT discussion/consent for the iMPACT study, however, participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive an additional follow-up call about the FRP or no follow-up call (usual care). Participants who are randomized to usual care will be provided a phone number for the Lazarex Foundation that they or their parent or legal guardian may contact directly. Therefore all patients or parents/legal guardians of patients in the study have access to FRP eligibility assessment through the Lazarex Foundation.\n\nParticipants or parents/legal guardians of participants will be surveyed at baseline (time of consent to iMPACT) and interviewed 30 days after consent to iMPACT. If a participant enrolls in a therapeutic clinical trial, he/she will also be given an additional survey after TCT participation and interviewed up to 90 days after TCT participation."
