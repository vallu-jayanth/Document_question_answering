It will evaluate quality of life (QOL) issues as they relate to treatment-related side effects, cosmetic result and patient convenience. It will evaluate outcome in terms of local control in the treated breast.\n\nRadiosurgery is defined as the stereotactic delivery of ionizing radiation in 5 stages or less to a designated target with sub-millimeter accuracy. Radiosurgery in the context of this protocol will be given to the region of the tumor bed with 7 weeks of the lumpectomy and sent/axillary node sampling over the period of five to ten days using the Cyberknife (CK) or within the 7 weeks of the last chemotherapy treatment if given."
