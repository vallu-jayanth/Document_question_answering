All patients will receive standard of care (Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy and diagnosis).\n\nFine needle aspiration: Fine needle aspiration is a type of biopsy procedure to diagnose suspicious lesions. After giving numbing medicine, a thin needle is inserted into the breast to obtain a sample. This procedure is followed by the standard of care and will last about 10 minutes. The sample will be analyzed by a diagnostic cartridge and by the cytopathologist.\n\nCancer Detection cartridge: The Cancer Detection cartridge has the ability to measure methylated gene changes in breast cells. The device will not be in contact with the patients. The FNA samples will be smeared on a slide which will be placed into the cartridge for analysis."
