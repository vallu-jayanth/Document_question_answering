If insensitive, the patient will receive six cycles of cisplatin and pemetrexed. Then the patient will receive tumor response evaluation. The patient with response or stable disease will receive maintenance therapy with one or some of the drugs including bevacizumab, pemetrexed, gemcitabine and docetaxel until disease progression. During experience all patients will receive clinical observation. Once proven for disease progression the patient will finish the experiment.",
