There is a controversy regarding the effect of the two Body Mass Index (BMI) extremes on the oncological outcome of rectal cancer.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of BMI on short- and long-term oncological outcomes as well as postoperative complications in rectal cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by surgery.\n\nSetting:\n\nTertiary Cancer Center serving pediatric and adult patients in Jordan and the Middle East.\n\nPatients:\n\nThe medical records of patients with stage II-III rectal cancer who received nCRT followed by surgery during 2006 to 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were subdivided according to their BMI into less than 20 kg/m2 defined as underweight; between 20 to 30 kg/m2 defined as normal range weight, above 30 kg/m2 defined as obese.\n\nMain Outcome Measures:\n\nDisease-Free Survival (DFS), Overall Survival, Pathological Complete Response (CR)"
