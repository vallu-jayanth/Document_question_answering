Giving erlotinib together with everolimus may kill more tumor cells.\n\nPURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving erlotinib together with everolimus and to see how well it works in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer.",
                "DetailedDescription": "OBJECTIVES:\n\nPrimary\n\nTo determine the safety of everolimus given in combination with erlotinib hydrochloride in patients with metastatic breast cancer (phase I).\nTo determine the antitumor activity of the combination (phase II).\nDetermine the rate of clinical benefit (complete response + partial response + stable disease for at least 6 months) in patients with metastatic breast cancer (phase II).\n\nSecondary\n\nTo determine the time to progression.\nTo determine PTEN, pAkt, pP70S6K1 and pEGFR in primary tumors at baseline.\n\nOUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose escalation phase I study followed by an open-label phase II study.\n\nPhase I: Patients receive escalating doses of oral everolimus and oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Once the MTD is reached, the recommended dose to be used in the phase II portion of the study is identified.\nPhase II: Patients receive oral everolimus and oral erlotinib hydrochloride as in phase I at the recommended phase II dose determined in phase I.\n\nPatients undergo tissue collection to evaluate tumor levels of PTEN, pAkt, pP70S6K1, and pEGFR at baseline in order to identify predictors of therapeutic response.\n\nAfter completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years (from study entry), every 6 months for 3 years, and annually thereafter.\n\nNOTE: Phase I completed. Investigator did not proceed with Phase II"
