                "BriefSummary": "For African American women (AAW) in Houston, cervical cancer mortality is disproportionate to their racial and ethnic counterparts.Most notably, lack of human papillomavirus (HPV) screening, vaccination, and later diagnosis increase cervical cancer mortality. However, cervical cancer is largely preventable. While previous research has identified only a few social determinants that are specifically related to cervical cancer, there may be a host of additional social and cultural factors that contribute to a lack of preventative behavior. The overall objective of the proposed study is to gather preliminary data to determine whether the use of concept mapping methodology is useful in identifying unique sociocultural determinants of cervical cancer prevention behavior, and to pilot test the feasibility of a podcast video developed using the information garnered from the concept mapping procedure. It is hypothesized that the resulting podcast video will increase HPV knowledge and behavioral intentions. Proof of concept and feasibility are needed first, in determining the utility of both the methodology and media development procedures, as well as data on preliminary effect outcomes, before further investigation and program development."
