Research is being conducted to understand how workplace factors influence breast cancer patients' ability to adhere to recommended cancer treatment and effectively recover from cancer. Investigators hope to use the findings from the study to help working breast cancer survivors make informed decisions about treatment and employment in collaboration with their employers and healthcare providers.",

They will be asked questions about their experiences in managing their cancer while taking care of their job responsibilities. Patients will be asked to complete a survey that asks questions about their breast cancer treatment, their job, and how they manage their responsibilities while undergoing cancer treatment.\n\nThe first initial meeting will be conducted at a time and location that is convenient for the patient. This meeting should last about an hour to an hour and a half.\n\nThree and six months after the initial interview, study participants will be asked to complete a follow-up survey by either telephone or Internet/Web, depending on their preference. These telephone surveys will last between 15-30 minutes."
