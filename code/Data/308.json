                "BriefSummary": "Background:\n\n- Radiation is a common treatment for prostate cancer. It helps damage tumor cells and causes them to die. Radiation can be effective, but some tumors may be harder to treat with radiation or even with surgery. This happens to a small number of men who have either radiation or surgery for prostate cancer. Most men who have these hard-to-treat tumors do not know if the tumor has recurred only in the prostate or has spread to another area. Also, men whose prostate cancer has recurred only after radiation may have different treatment options. This study will use improved imaging studies to better understand why some men do not respond as well to initial radiation treatments.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To use detailed imaging studies to look at the results of local radiation therapy for prostate cancer.\n\nEligibility:\n\nMen at least 18 years of age who are scheduled to have radiation for prostate cancer.\nMen at least 18 years of age whose prostate cancer has returned after earlier treatments.\n\nDesign:\n\nAll participants will have a medical history and physical exam. Blood and urine samples will be collected. Imaging studies will be used to evaluate the cancer at the start of the study.\nAll participants will have an initial full magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the prostate. Tumor and healthy tissue samples will be collected.\nThose whose cancer has recurred after treatment will discuss possible treatment options with the study doctors.\nParticipants who are scheduled to have radiation will have radiation therapy. This will be given according to the current standard of treatment.\nAfter radiation, participants will have regular follow-up tests and imaging studies. They will have another full MRI scan 6 months after the end of radiation treatment.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Background:\n\nRadiation therapy is a commonly used therapy for prostate cancers. The majority of men with prostate cancer will be cured by therapy; however a subset, typically men with bulky or higher risk disease will develop PSA failure after definitive radiotherapy.\n\nCurrently, men with a rising PSA after radiotherapy may receive hormonal therapy or may undergo further evaluation for local failure.\n\nIt is not known how many men with rising PSA after radiotherapy may have a local failure and would benefit from a salvage local therapy. With the availability of a growing number of local salvage options, accurately defining the presence and characteristics of local failure is critical.\n\nObjective:\n\nTo determine the rate of local recurrence in patients with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy using multiparametric prostate MR guided and standard biopsies\n\nEligibility:\n\nPatients with no local therapy for prostate cancer:\n\nAge greater than or equal to 18 years\n\nHistologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate\n\nIntermediate or high risk prostate cancer (clinical stage greater than or equal to T2b, Gleason score 7 or higher, or PSA greater than10, extracapsular extension or seminal vesicle invasion on MRI).\n\nPatient will be treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer.\n\nECOG performance status less than or equal to 2\n\nPatients with biochemical relapse after radiotherapy for prostate cancer:\n\nEvidence of prostate cancer recurrence (palpable abnormality after radiotherapy, radiographic evidence of local failure, biochemical relapse)\n\nECOG performance status less than or equal to 2\n\nAge greater than or equal to 18 years\n\nHistologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate\n\nDesign:\n\nPatients with untreated prostate cancer:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, laboratory tests (CBC, chemistries, liver transaminases, PSA, PT/PTT), and imaging studies (as appropriate to staging).\n\nPatients will undergo multiparametric MR imaging and MR guided prostate biopsy of all suspicious lesions (diagnostic and research)\n\nPatients will receive radiotherapy at NIH or at an outside facility.\n\nPatients will return for follow up at 3 month intervals for the first 2 years and then every six months for 5 years for PSA measurement.\n\nPatients will undergo a multiparametric MR at 6 months after therapy. No biopsy is obtained unless patients meet the definition of treatment failure. This study would allow future correlation with early changes that may predict for eventual outcome.\n\nPatients with a rising PSA that meet the criteria for biochemical failure by the Phoenix definition will undergo repeat multiparametric prostate MRI with biopsy of suspicious lesions (diagnostic and research).\n\nPatients with recurrent prostate cancer:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, laboratory tests (CBC, chemistries, Liver transaminases, PSA, PT/PTT), and imaging studies.\n\nPatients will undergo multiparametric MR imaging and MR guided prostate biopsy of all suspicious lesions (diagnostic and research)\n\n120 patients with untreated prostate cancer and 100 patients with biochemical recurrence after radiotherapy will be accrued to this study."
