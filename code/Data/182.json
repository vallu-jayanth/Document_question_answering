In this prospective cohort it will be tested whether repeated measure of biomarkers of risk allows early detection of lung cancer.",

The expected prevalence of lung cancer in this high risk group is estimated to be 2% per year. All individuals benefit from clinic visit, low-dose Chest CT, spirometry and auto-fluorescence bronchoscopy at baseline, Chest CT, follow-up doctor visit, and auto-fluorescence bronchoscopy at least at year 2 and 5."
