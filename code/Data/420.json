Gene mutations are when DNA in a gene is damaged in a way that changes the genetic message carried by that gene. Gene mutations can sometimes cause lung cancers. These gene mutations are only found in lung and colorectal cancer cells, not the normal cells in your body. All lung cancer tumors and colorectal cancer tumors are now tested for different gene mutations as their presence affects lung cancer treatment. Tumor samples obtained from a biopsy or surgery are typically tested for these gene mutations."
