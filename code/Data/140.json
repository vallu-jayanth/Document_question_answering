This is defined as family history of pancreas cancer that meet the criteria listed below.\n\nIf at least two affected relatives who are First degree relatives (FDR) to each other, of whom at least one is an FDR to the individual considered for surveillance\nIf at least three affected relatives on the same side of the family, of whom at least one is an FDR to the individual considered for surveillance\nIf at least two affected relatives on the same side of the family, of whom at least one is an FDR to the individual considered for surveillance Screening is usually initialed at age 50 years or 10 years younger than the youngest family member with pancreatic cancer\n\nPatients with genetic susceptibility to pancreas cancer\n\nPatients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome diagnosed with using clinical criteria or with a deleterious mutation in liver kinase B1/Serine/threonine kinase 11 (LKB1/STK11). Screening is usually initiated at age 40 years or later.\nPatients with Familial Atypical Multiple Mole Melanoma Syndrome (FAMMM syndrome), diagnosed using clinical criteria or CDKN2A p16 mutation.\n\nScreening is usually initiated at age 45 years or 10 years younger than the youngest family member with pancreatic cancer.\n\nHereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer syndrome: diagnosed using clinical criteria or deleterious Breast Cancer gene 1 (BRCA1), Breast Cancer gene 2 (BRCA2), Partner and Localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2). The usual indication for screening is:\n\nBRCA1 mutation and at least one affected first-degree relative with pancreatic cancer\nBRCA 2 mutation and at least one affected first-degree relative, or at least two relatives of any degree with pancreatic cancer\nPALB2 mutation and at least one affected first-degree relative with pancreatic cancer Screening is usually initiated at age 45 or 10 years younger than the youngest family member with pancreatic cancer; or per updated national screening guidelines\n\nLynch syndrome or Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) mutations with at least one affected first-degree relative (FDR). Lynch syndrome could be diagnosed either by using clinical criteria or Mutator L homolog 1 (MLH1), Mutator S homolog 2 (MSH2), Mutator S homolog 6 (MSH6), Postmeiotic Segregation Increased, S. Cerevisiae, 2 (PMS2) or EPCAM mutation.\n\nScreening to be initiated at age 45 or 10 years younger than the youngest family member with pancreatic cancer.\n\nPatients with hereditary pancreatitis diagnosed using clinical criteria or deleterious Serine Protease 1 (PRSS1) mutation. Screening is usually initiated at age 40 years or 10 years younger than the youngest family member with pancreatic cancer 3. New-onset diabetes, age > 50 years with weight loss. 4.
