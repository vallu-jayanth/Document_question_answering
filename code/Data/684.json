                "DetailedDescription": "This is a retrospective analysis of Prostate Cancer patients from m0HSPC, m1HSPC, m0CRPC, m1CRPC followed in the Prostate Cancer Database Sweden (PCBaSe) database. The patient population consists of men recorded in Patient-overview Prostate Cancer (PPC) between 1 January 2014 until death or 31 December 2016. Patient history to 2006 was collected by retrospective charted review.\n\nData will be extracted from PPC for the different Prostate Cancer (PCa) disease stages, from m0HSPC, m1HSPC, m0CRPC, m1CRPC until progression or death. The prostate cancer disease progression from m0HSPC, m1HSPC, m0CRPC, m1CRPC until progression or death has not been recorded in a systematic way. Given the complexity of this disease, the aim of this study is to have a comprehensive understanding about the disease progression in prostate cancer, from m0HSPC, m1HSPC, m0CRPC, m1CRPC until progression or death.\n\nIn addition, the following will be collected: co-morbidities, co-medication, health care resource utilization and costs, as well as other health economic variables such as sick leave and early retirement at the different disease stages."
