Doctors leading this study hope to learn if combining durvalumab, carboplatin and etoposide with hyofractionated ablative radiation therapy (radiation focused on certain parts of the body) will help treat your cancer and improve how long you can live with extensive-stage small cell cancer without it getting worse (progression-free survival). Your participation in this research will last about 48 months.\n\nDurvalumab along with chemotherapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of small cell lung cancer along with chemotherapy. This study is testing the addition of radiation to durvalumab and chemotherapy."

The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\nPatients with vitiligo or alopecia\nPatients with hypothyroidism (e.g., following Hashimoto syndrome) stable on hormone replacement\nAny chronic skin condition that does not require systemic therapy\nPatients without active disease in the last 5 years may be included but only after consultation with the study physician\nPatients with celiac disease controlled by diet alone\nUncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, serious chronic gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written informed consent\n\nHistory of another primary malignancy except for\n\nMalignancy treated with curative intent and with no known active disease \u22655 years before the first dose of IP and of low potential risk for recurrence\nAdequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or lentigo maligna without evidence of disease\nAdequately treated carcinoma in situ without evidence of disease\nHistory of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis\nHas a paraneoplastic syndrome (PNS) of autoimmune nature, requiring systemic treatment (systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents) or has a clinical symptomatology suggesting worsening of PNS.\nAll patients at screening should have an MRI (preferred) or CT each preferably with IV contrast of the brain prior to study entry. Patients whose brain metastases have been treated may participate provided they show radiographic stability (defined as 2 brain images, both of which are obtained after treatment to the brain metastases. These imaging scans should both be obtained at least two weeks apart and show no evidence of intracranial progression). In addition, any neurologic symptoms that developed either as a result of the brain metastases or their treatment must have resolved or be stable either, without the use of steroids, or are stable on a steroid dose of \u226410mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent for at least 14 days prior to the start of treatment. Brain metastases will not be recorded as RECIST Target Lesions at baseline.\nHistory of active primary immunodeficiency\nActive infection including tuberculosis (clinical evaluation that includes clinical history, physical examination and radiographic findings, and tuberculosis (TB) testing in line with local practice), hepatitis B (known positive HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) result), hepatitis C, or HIV. Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the presence of hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc] and absence of HBsAg) are eligible. Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction is negative for hepatitis C (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA).\n\nCurrent or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days before the first dose of durvalumab. The following are exceptions to this criterion:\n\nIntranasal, inhaled, topical steroids, or local steroid injections (e.g., intra articular injection)\nSystemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or its equivalent\nSteroids as premedication for hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., CT scan premedication)\nReceipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP. Note: Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving IP and up to 30 days after the last dose of IP.\nFemale patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female patients of reproductive potential who are not willing to employ effective birth control from screening to 90 days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy.\nKnown allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs or any of the study drug excipients.\nPrior randomisation or treatment in a previous durvalumab clinical study regardless of treatment arm assignment.\nHas received prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy or thoracic radiation for small cell lung cancer.\nHas prior exposure to anti-PD (Programmed death-ligand 1) 1/PD-L1 or anti- cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA4) therapy.\nHas had prior radiation therapy (defined as >10% of prior prescription dose) to the area planning to be treated with trial RT.\n\nProcedures for withdrawal of incorrectly enrolled patients are presented in Section 4.3",
