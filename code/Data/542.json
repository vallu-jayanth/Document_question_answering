Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic cholangiopancreatography (MRI/MRCP) will be utilized to screen for early stage pancreatic cancer or precursor lesions. Participants will be asked to donate a blood sample at specific intervals for the creation of a bio-bank necessary for the development of a blood based screening test for Pancreatic Cancer.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Individuals 50 years of age and older who have a family history of pancreatic cancer will be recruited through the offices of primary care physicians and endocrinologists. Those meeting initial criteria will meet with a research APRN and will undergo a secondary screen to determine eligibility. Individuals enrolled in the study will undergo a five-minute psychological survey and donation of a blood sample for bio-bank analysis every 6 months for 3 years. MRI will be performed annually for 3 years (4 in total). Any abnormalities on MRI will be reviewed by a multi-disciplinary tumor board and discussed with the participant. The costs of MRI will be covered by the study."
