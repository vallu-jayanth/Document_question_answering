                "BriefSummary": "Upon the completion of aggressive chemotherapy and radiation for curative intent cancers, many cancer survivors suffer from a myriad of symptoms ranging from physical symptoms such as hot flashes, insomnia, and fatigue to psychosocial symptoms including depression and anxiety. Mindfulness Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) is a type of mind-body intervention. Mind-body interventions are defined as practices or interventions that focus on the connection and integration of the mind and body and the ability for these connections to effect changes on physical, emotional and spiritual levels for the purpose of promoting health and well being.",
                "DetailedDescription": "MBCR is a step wise standardized behavioral intervention of MBSR. The program is usually conducted in eight weekly class sessions that are 2-2.5 hours in length. During class sessions, participants are presented with mindfulness meditation techniques and share their experiences related to these meditation practices. There is a home practice component with an expectation of regular home meditation practice of 45 minutes per day. In addition to home meditation practice there are often reading assignments and reflective exercises that relate to mindfulness. A full day retreat generally occurs in the second half of the course, providing an opportunity for class participants to gain extended experience with mindfulness techniques."
