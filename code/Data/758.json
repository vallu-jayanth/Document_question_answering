Patients included will require a low-dose thoracic CT scan to be performed by a radiologist of their choice. Smoking cessation will be systematically proposed, and will be carried out by the general practitioner or a tobaccologist.\n\nThe radiation dose from thoracic CT scans should not exceed 100 mGy.cm Product Dose Length (i.e. < 1.5 mSv). Imaging reports will be forwarded to the general practitioner.\n\nIf the first CT scan is negative (T0): a second scan will be scheduled 1 year later (T1). If this second scan is also negative, in the absence of lung cancer risk factors other than smoking, scans will then be performed every two years. In the presence of a risk factor for lung cancer (other than tobacco), screening will remain annual.\n\nIn the event of a result classified as uncertain: a follow-up scan is scheduled at 3 months ; if the follow-up scan is negative, the next screening will be scheduled 1 year after this follow-up scan. If the screening performed 1 year later is also negative, subsequent screenings will be performed annually.\n\nIn the event of a positive result: the general practitioner will refer the patient to a pneumologist of his/her choice for further examinations; data from these additional examinations will be collected.\n\nThe screening protocol may evolve in line with recommendations issued by the French National Authority for Health (HAS).\n\nFor participants undergoing CT scan at the imaging department of Emile Muller hospital in Mulhouse (GHRMSA), a blood sample will be collected (optional) for subsequent biomarker assays."
