It will profile the immune response to cryoablation of invasive breast cancers. The intra-tumoral and systemic immune response to cryoablation will be determined and compared to pre-ablated breast cancer specimens and historical control specimens.",

Approximately six weeks after cryoablation, definitive breast surgery will be performed. Blood will be drawn for research before cryoablation and surgery and at regular follow-up visits. Blood and tissue samples will be used to determine immune responses."
