                "BriefSummary": "FMG2025 continues the previous efforts to propose treatment for patients based on the molecular characteristics of their tumor at treatment failure in cancer precision medicine trials within standard of care in France. However, whereas FMG2025 is a descriptive effort providing the basis for clinical decisions, MAPPYACTS 2 will translate these findings to clinical actions. The symbiosis is critical to advance patient care.\n\nSince 2012, the molecular profiling trials \"MOlecular Screening for CAncer Treatment Optimization\" (MOSCATO-01) and \"MoleculAr Profiling for Pediatric and Young Adult Cancer Treatment Stratification\" (MAPPYACTS) have included pediatric and adolescent patients with recurrent or refractory malignancy that underwent on-purpose biopsy or surgical intervention. Whole Exome Sequencing of tumor and normal tissue and RNA Sequencing of tumor tissue have been applied to detect genomic alterations that could lead to an adapted targeted treatment. Furthermore, ancillary studies were associated exploring circulating tumor DNA, the immune contexture of tumors and developing Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDX).\n\nThe FMG2025 project transfers the molecular profiling of advanced pediatric cancers into a global approach that is now considered standard of care in France. Subsequent clinical recommendations and decisions will be made based on discussions with biologists, scientist and physicians in the molecular and clinical molecular tumor boards. Associated ancillary research studies and links to clinical interventional studies remain essential elements of the program to provide clinical, translational and basic research in order to improve scientific knowledge.\n\nThe program is articulated in two main parts that are closely interacting:\n\nFMG2025 - Cancers et leuc\u00e9mies p\u00e9diatriques en \u00e9chec de traitement or equivalent international projects that cover the sequencing of tumor and blood samples and provide molecular reports.\n\nThe clinical study MAPPYACTS 2 that provides clinical and therapeutic discussions of the sequencing results and therapy recommendations via the clinical molecular tumor board reports. It collects molecular and comprehensive clinical data of the patients registered in FMG2025 or equivalent international projects and thereby constitutes the critical link to clinical interventional studies and its sponsors ensuring facilitated access to these trials. It also covers and coordinates ancillary research studies.",
                "DetailedDescription": "MAPPYACTS 2 is a prospective international multicentric clinical study to provide clinical therapeutic recommendations, to set up the molecular and comprehensive clinical database of patients with relapsed or refractory pediatric malignancies in FMG2025 - Cancers et leuc\u00e9mies p\u00e9diatriques en \u00e9chec de traitement or equivalent international projects, to collect the follow-up data on treatment and patients' outcome, in order to determine the outcome of the program in regard to benefit to the patient, all the patients and to health care. It will also serve as a central link to interventional study platforms and international precision medicine programs, and to cover and coordinate ancillary research studies that lead to improved treatment and outcome for children with advanced malignancies.\n\nSubsequent clinical recommendations and decisions will be made based on discussions with biologists, scientists and physicians in the molecular and clinical molecular tumor boards run by the MAPPYACTS 2 study teams.\n\nAssociated ancillary research studies and links to clinical interventional studies are essential components of the program to perform clinical, translational and basic research in order to generate scientific knowledge and develop new treatment strategies that improve outcome of these patients. Research projects will be discussed and agreed on in the MAPPYACTS 2 study committee."
