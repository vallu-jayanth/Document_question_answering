                "BriefSummary": "68Ga-PSMA is a radiopharmaceutical used with PET imaging for the detection of prostate cancer under a compassionate IND in patients who have presented with biochemical failure. In this study, the use of 68Ga-PSMA-11 will be extended to newly diagnosed patients with high risk prostate cancer. Patients enrolled to this study will undergo a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT or PET/MRI scan for research purposes (in addition to the routine CT or MRI that is routinely done for staging), and a second 68Ga-PSMA-11 administration just prior to surgery for experimental ex-vivo beta probe testing of resected tissue. Immediately following resection of the prostate, the intact tissue will be scanned using a PET camera designed for animal research in order to record the 68Ga-PSMA-11 distribution in the isolated tissue at higher resolution than can be attained using whole-body PET imaging. The experimental beta probe will then be use to measure 68Ga-PSMA-11 counts of the resected tissue.",
