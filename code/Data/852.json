                "BriefSummary": "Patients with esophageal cancer that had metastatic lesions after been treated with surgery or definitive chemoradiotherapy are being asked to participate in this study.\n\nApatinib is a small-molecule vascular endothelial growth factors receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, similar to vatalanib (PTK787), but with a binding affinity 10 times that of vatalanib or sorafenib.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine what effects apatinib has on metastatic esophageal cancer. These effects include whether apatinib could shrink the tumor or slow down its growth and what side effects apatinib will have on the tumor.",
                "DetailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to determine what effects apatinib has on metastatic esophageal cancer patients after been treated with surgery or definitive chemoradiotherapy. These effects include whether apatinib could shrink the tumor or slow down its growth and what side effects apatinib will have on the tumor.\n\nEligible are patients with metastatic esophageal cancer who have achieved stable disease or have disease progression after systemic therapy (surgery or definitive chemoradiotherapy) and have at least one separate measurable sites of metastatic lesions. Extent of metastatic disease is recorded either at CT or MRI scanning. Apatinib (850mg) is given daily during the therapy for 28 days. Tumor response is evaluated by assessing clinical and CT/MRI response in the metastatic sites. A Phase II clinical trial based on an optimum two-stage Phase II Simon design is used to conduct this pilot study. Ten patients will be treated in Stage one; if there are no tumor responses, the trial will be terminated. If there are one or more responses in Stage One, the trial will proceed to enroll an additional 19 patients."
