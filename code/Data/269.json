                "DetailedDescription": "Introduction\n\nEsophageal cancer is the seventh most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The overall five-year survival is below 20%.\n\nIt is characterized by its high mortality rate, poor prognosis at time of diagnosis and variability based on geographic location. Now , the prevalence of esophageal cancer is in transition .\n\nThe Arabic world has very low incidences of Esophageal cancer in general. In Egypt, it represents 1.7% of all cancers.\n\nEsophagectomy followed by reconstruction surgery has been the most reliable modality for treatment in patients without evidence of disease spread.\n\nDifferent surgical approaches, such as the Sweet esophagectomy, Ivor Lewis esophagectomy, McKeown esophagectomy, and transhiatal esophagectomy, have been used clinically based on specific locations in the esophageal cancer.\n\nFor cancer of the middle or lower segment of the thoracic esophagus, the Ivor Lewis esophagectomy and the Sweet esophagectomy through the left thoracic approach are the mainstream standard surgical approaches.\n\nConventional surgical treatment involves open esophagectomy (OE) using transthoracic or transhiatal approaches which are associated with high mortality and morbidity especially respiratory complications (RCs) that are common with open esophagectomy and can increase the risk of death by up to 20%.\n\nTraditionally, an esophagectomy was performed through a right thoracotomy and laparotomy. However, these patients are at a high risk for developing postoperative pulmonary complications. In order to decrease postoperative morbidity, minimally invasive surgical techniques were introduced in the treatment of esophageal cancer.\n\nThe first thoracoscopic esophageal mobilizations for esophagectomy were performed in the early 1990s by A. Cuschieri.\n\nThen, DePaula and colleagues and Swanstr\u00f6m and Hansen separately published the first totally minimally invasive transhiatal esophagectomies in 1995 and 1997, respectively. Subsequently, many centers began to adapt their preferred technique to minimally invasive approaches and gained significant experience in laparoscopic and thoracoscopic approaches to esophagectomy.\n\nLuketich et al. first identified the combined thoracoscopic esophageal mobilization followed by the laparoscopic fashioning of the gastric conduit and the development of an esophagogastric anastomosis in the cervical region.\n\nIn recent decades, minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) has become an alternative to open esophagectomy. minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) involves several techniques including total MIE (tMIE), hybrid minimally invasive esophagectomy (hMIE), and robotic surgery .\n\nThe procedure consists presently of three main techniques: combined thoracoscopic and laparoscopic approach (Ivor Lewis); thoracoscopic, laparoscopic, and cervical approach (three-hole); or laparoscopic and cervical approach only (transhiatal).\n\nLuketich et al. subsequently published their approach to minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy and intrathoracic anastomosis and concluded that this type of treatment is feasible.\n\nMI McKeown esophagectomy procedure consists of thoracoscopic esophagectomy, laparoscopic gastric mobilization, and cervical anastomosis between the esophageal stump and gastric stump. With the improvement of techniques and equipment, McKeown MIE has received increased attention.\n\nObjectives:\n\nEvaluate the feasibility and outcome of minimally invasive management of esophageal cancer regarding\n\nSurgical technique:\n\nA totally minimally invasive technique (combined thoracoscopic and laparoscopic approaches) for esophagectomy will be used in this study. Also, a hybrid technique (thoracoscopic approach with laparotomy or laparoscopic approach with thoracotomy) will be included.\n\nHistopathology\n\nAssessment of surgical margins\nAssessment of the number of lymph nodes\n\nPeri-operative outcome including\n\nOperative time\nConversion to open\nBlood loss\nHospital stays\nEvaluation of recurrence, disease-free survival and overall survival rates: according to The Kaplan-Meier estimator\nMorbidity and mortality.\n\nAim of the work This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and outcome of minimally invasive management of esophageal cancer.\n\nStudy Design:\n\nThis study is going to be a prospective study where patients presenting with esophageal cancer who are considered candidates for surgery will undergo minimally invasive surgery. Each patient will be assessed in the pre, intra, and short postoperative period.\n\nMethodology:\n\nPopulation of study & disease Condition patients with esophageal cancer.\nBackground and Demographic characteristics Any patient with esophageal cancer is considered a candidate for a minimally invasive esophagectomy procedure.\n\nInclusion criteria:\n\nAny age.\nAny sex.\nDiagnostic operable esophageal cancer.\n\nExclusion criteria:\n\nMetastatic patients.\nLocally advanced cases.\nPatients with comorbidities who are unfit for major surgical procedures.\nPatients with contraindications for laparoscopy or thoracoscopy.\n\nInterventions:\n\nPatients with esophageal cancer who are considered candidates for surgery will be subjected to minimally invasive procedures through a combined laparoscopic and thoracoscopic approach with D2 dissection and mediastinal dissection.\n\nPossible Risk:\n\nThe main risks are the same as Open esophagectomy Procedures as surgical site complications, pulmonary complications, bleeding, Leakage, mediastinitis, fluid collection, and stenosis.\n\nAlso, there is a risk of conversion from minimally invasive to open technique.\n\nPrimary outcome parameters:\n\nThe primary outcome will be the assessment of operative time, hospital stay, intraoperative and early postoperative complications, and the assessment of pathology regarding surgical margins and the retrieved lymph nodes.\n\nSecondary outcome parameters:\n\nThe secondary outcome will be the incidence of late complications such as anastomotic stenosis and reflux symptoms and also the incidence of locoregional recurrence.\n\nSample size (number of participants included) All patients with esophageal cancer who are considered candidates for esophagectomy present to NCI in the period of 2 years starting November 2022 till October 2024.\n\nStatistical analysis:\n\nData will be collected in preformed data collection before being entered in the spreadsheet. Statistical analysis will be performed using the statistical package for social science (SPSS). Continuous variables will be expressed as mean and standard deviation (normally distributed data) or median and range (not normally distributed data) while categorical data expressed as numbers and percentages.\n\nChi-square test will be used to compare the nominal data while continuous data will be compared by the student t-test (normally distributed data) and Mann-Whitney test (not normally distributed data).\n\nSource of funding:\n\nSelf-funding."
