                "DetailedDescription": "Participants in this study will be part of a pancreatic cancer genetic epidemiology consortium (herein referred to as \"PACGENE\"), which includes researchers at these institutions: Mayo Clinic; Johns Hopkins University; Creighton University; University of Toronto Mount Sinai Hospital; Dana Farber; and Karmanos Cancer Institute. Participants have either been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer or are family members of pancreatic cancer patients.\n\nParticipants will be asked questions by a trained interviewer using an approved questionnaire. The topics will include demographic data (age, race, etc.), exposures, medical history data, family history of cancer and other conditions, and other lifestyle factors. It should take about 30-40 minutes to complete the questionnaire.\n\nParticipants in this study will also have about one and a half tablespoons of blood drawn. Blood that is collected will only be used by researchers involved in this study. If obtaining a blood sample is not possible, the study staff will ask for a saliva sample using an ORAGENE kit. Neither participants nor their physicians will receive individual reports of this research. Results will not be placed in the participant's health records. All information will be kept confidential and used only for this research.\n\nThere is a rare chance that a research team member could be accidentally exposed to your blood or body fluids. If that occurs, extra blood (about 2 teaspoons) may be drawn to test for infections such as hepatitis and HIV (the AIDS virus). An existing blood sample may be used for these tests instead. You will be told that your blood is being tested and the results of your test. Researchers will ask how you would like to receive the results, such as by phone or certified letter. The test results and your name, address, date of birth, and sex will be recorded in the confidential M. D. Anderson medical records.\n\nIf you test positive for hepatitis or HIV, the test results and your name, address, date of birth, and sex will be shared with appropriate health authorities as required by law. You will also be given a list of places in your area so that you can receive further testing and treatment.\n\nFor the protection of your privacy, the study staff has obtained a Certificate of Confidentiality from the National Institutes of Health. With this certificate, the researchers cannot be forced to disclose information that may identify you, even by a court subpoena, in any federal, state, or local civil, criminal, administrative, legislative, or other proceedings. The researchers will use the certificate to resist any demands for information that would identify you, except as explained below.\n\nThe certificate cannot be used to resist a demand for information from personnel of the United State Government that is used for auditing or evaluation of Federally funded projects or for information that must be disclosed in order to meet the requirements of the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nYou should understand that a Certificate of Confidentiality does not prevent you or a member of your family from voluntarily releasing information about yourself or your involvement in this research. If an insurer, employer, or other person obtains your written consent to receive research information, then the researchers may not use the certificate to withhold that information.\n\nThis is an investigational study. This study will include a total of 1,000 participants recruited at M. D. Anderson."
