                "BriefSummary": "Researchers from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center are conducting a research study on a Chinese herbal medicine known as \"Jin Fu Kang\". We want to see if this can help patients with advanced lung cancer. Jin Fu Kang might reduce the growth of cancer or improve quality of life. You are eligible for this trial because your cancer has progressed after prior chemotherapy and your doctor has recommended further chemotherapy treatment.\n\nLung cancer that has been confirmed and that has spread is called advanced cancer. There is no known permanent cure for advanced lung cancer, but chemotherapy may temporarily shrink the cancer and improve the quality of patients' lives.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Jin Fu Kang is a herbal medicine specially developed in China for the treatment of lung cancer. It is based on a traditional medicine that is widely used and appears to be safe. Although clinical trials in China suggest that Jin Fu Kang may be of benefit, it has never been researched in patients with lung cancer in the United States. As such, its risks and benefits are not fully understood.\n\nThe scientific aims are to determine the toxicity of Jin Fu Kang/docetaxel combination treatment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, to determine whether Jin Fu Kang alters the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel and to provide preliminary efficacy and survival data for Jin Fu Kang/docetaxel combination treatment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer."
