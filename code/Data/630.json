The study primary outcome was retreatment-free survival (RFS) defined as any additional further treatment: local (FT/PGA for in-field or out-of-field recurrences or radical prostatectomy or external beam radiotherapy or whole gland HIFU) or systemic salvage treatment, a positive biopsy revealing PCa with an ISUP grade\u2265 2 in nontreated patients, PCa metastasis or PCa specific death.
