                "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether certain genes in cancer may be abnormal. When a gene is abnormal this is called a mutation. Most mutations in cancer cells are not inherited (passed down from parents) but happen after birth in the cancer itself. Most cancers have many mutations. Some of these mutations are important for the cancer cells to survive while others are not. The goal of this study is test cancer for certain mutations using leftover tumor tissue from a previous surgery or biopsy. Participants will also be asked to provide a tube of blood cheek (also known as a buccal) swab, or a saliva sample that contains normal genes for comparison.\n\nThe purpose of Part B of this study is to:\n\nUnderstand how genetic changes in tumor effect the chance of responding to experimental cancer treatment. Understand how the genes in the tumor change overtime in response to targeted cancer treatment."
