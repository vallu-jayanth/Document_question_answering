                "BriefSummary": "Bladder cancer is the 5th most common cancer in Europe, with more than 151,000 new cases diagnosed in 2012 (4% of the total). Bladder cancer has the highest recurrence rate of any malignancy, often as high as 70% within 5 years of successful treatment. This high recurrence rate requires diligent and accurate monitoring as a means for early diagnosis and treatment. Considering the burden associated to repeated invasive cystoscopies, there is a need for robust but accurate tests for surveillance. In that prospect, urinary molecular tests have been developed although none were deemed adequate in the European clinical guidelines to replace cystoscopies. The Xpert Bladder Cancer Monitor Assay is a qualitative in vitro diagnostic test designed to monitor for the recurrence of bladder cancer in patients previously diagnosed with this cancer. The test provides a fast and accurate result, is non-invasive and easy to perform. The aim of this study is to assess the non-inferiority of the Xpert Bladder Cancer Monitor assay in detecting recurrences in comparison to cystoscopy in the follow-up of patients with low or intermediate risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).",
