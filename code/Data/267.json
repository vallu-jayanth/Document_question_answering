                "DetailedDescription": "Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies affecting women worldwide, and its incidence has seen a steady increase over the years with the involvement of women at a much younger age, which poses a serious health threat to women and has a staggering global impact.\n\nLymph node and hematogenous metastasis occurs at the early stage of breast cancer and is the principal cause of mortality of breast cancer patients.\n\nSurgical resection is the most effective method for the treatment of breast cancer, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy reduces the risk of disease recurrence and death in women who have operable breast cancer.\n\nFor patients with inoperable breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy reduces tumor bulk and tumor stage, thereby increasing the chance of surgical resection and reducing postoperative tumor recurrence and metastasis.\n\nLocal or regional chemotherapy is an alternative for reducing metastatic lesions and increasing patient survival .Intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy (chemoinfusion), a form of regional chemotherapy, has been used in the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors, liver cancer, and pancreatic cancer.\n\nIn the present prospective study, we will analyze the outcome of image-guided delivery of intra-arterially infused chemotherapeutic drugs for patients with breast cancer in III, IV stages."
