Exclusion criteria consisted of age younger than 18 years, history of psychiatric illness, and preoperative radiotherapy.\n\nOutcome measures: patient was carried out using a EORTC QLQ-C30/C38 questionnaire.To determine how surgery affects QoL, we divided patients into two groups: first rectal cancer submitted to rectal anterior resection(RAR) and latter rectal cancer submitted to rectal anterior resection with stomia(RARS). Differences in QoL between the two groups were analyzed during three time: first preoperative, second postoperative and latter six month later of after the stoma reconversion in RARS patients"
