The primary objective is to measure the thioredoxin reductase activity using blood and lung cancer tissue and measure thioredoxin reductase messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expression using lung cancer and pericarcinomatous tissue in early staged(\u2160~\u2162A) non-small lung cancers, to study the correlations of thioredoxin reductase between blood and tissue. The secondary objectives are to measure the thioredoxin reductase activity between non small lung cancers and lung benign lesion patients to identify the difference between tumor and lung benign mass."
