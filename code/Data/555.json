                "BriefSummary": "SOLTI 1903 HOPE is a national, real world clinical practice study conducted in patients diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer who are receiving, have just received or will receive treatment for its advanced disease. Patients will lead their inclusion, participation and follow-up in the study through a digital tool, but they are encouraged to include their physician's in this study. Tissue samples from metastatic (preferred) or primary tumor will be collected for analyses, together with blood samples. A Molecular Advisory Board (MAB) will assess and give recommendations according patient's molecular profile.\n\nThe primary objective is to assess the real-world clinical practice of integration of molecular profiling in the Standard of Care (SoC) management of mBC patients connected through a digital tool.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Eligible patients are those who are 18 or older, either female or male, confirmed locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer of any subtype and who have received, are receiving, or will receive any line of treatment from metastatic disease.\n\nDemographic data, disease characteristics, treatment history, and quality of life data will be collected through a digital tool by the patient. The data are de-identified and will be used to advance multiple areas of research into mBC. The study will be complemented by a patient empowerment program that will include informative workshops and video-tutorials about precision medicine and the HOPE study itself. Tumor tissue samples must be submitted for genomic profiling using FoundationOne CDx. Blood samples for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) profiling using Guardant360 also will be collected.\n\nMolecular reports will be reviewed by the Molecular Advisory Board (MAB) and recommendations according to the molecular profile will be sent to the patients and physicians through the digital tool to let them know these treatment options and also notified about clinical trials for which they may be eligible.\n\nThe primary objective is to assess the real-world clinical practice of integration of molecular profiling in the Standard of Care (SoC) management of mBC patients connected through a digital tool. Secondary objectives include: to describe genetic mutational profile from both tests, to evaluate if a patient-centric strategy could achieve better enrollment than the classical approach site-physician-patient, and to assess the efficacy of the program to allocate patients in clinical trials."
