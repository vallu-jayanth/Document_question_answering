The treatment is equal to the standard of care.\n\nPotential biomarkers from a previous retrospective study will be validated in this prospective study.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Objectives:\n\nPrimary: Evaluation of local-regional recurrence- free survival after two years of patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer who received definitive or adjuvant radiochemotherapy.\n\nSecondary: Evaluation of disease-free -survival, metastases-free and overall survival after two years, of patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer.\n\nOutline: This is a multicenter observational study. The treatment is based on the center specific standard of care. The total dose will be between 69 and 73 Gy (definitive treatment) and 63 and 66 Gy (adjuvant treatment), the chemotherapy will be cisplatin- based.\n\nThe aim of the analysis is to validate the prognostic impact of potential biomarkers on loco-regional control. This will lead to the definition of risk groups and stratification of patients and will help to individualize radiotherapy prescription in future trials."
