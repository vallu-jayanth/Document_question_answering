                "BriefSummary": "Distress in cancer patients has been shown to be higher in females than males, but the behavior of distress during time in longitudinal prospective studies has not been studied, nor is it known if there are differences related to gender during time. These differences may have important therapeutic implications in terms of selective psychological support as cancer progresses during individual trajectories.\n\nThe aim of the present study is to examine the effect of gender during time on psychological distress and fatigue in cancer patients across a broad range of cancer types. It is hypothesized that women will report higher psychological distress than men at initial visit but a reversed trend will be observed during follow-up as a result of different coping capabilities between men and women.\n\nPatients attending a cancer outpatient clinic are invited to undergo a psychological session immediately before the medical visit. Distress is assessed by the Distress thermometer and fatigue by the ESAS-r scale at the end of the session. Patients will undergo follow-up visits to assess changes during time and possible time by gender interactions.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Distress and fatigue in cancer patients are important factors affecting treatment compliance and efficacy and quality of life. The prevalence of moderate or severe emotional distress in cancer patients ranges from 30 to 45% depending on a point of assessment. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network indicates that all cancer patients should undergo a distress measurement as the sixth vital parameter to prevent more serious psychological disorders, including anxiety, depression and coping disturbances. Several studies indicate that patients undergoing psychotherapy or psychosocial support to relieve cancer distress have better disease coping, a reduction of fatigue, anxiety and depression and an improvement in quality of live and possibly survival.\n\nDistress in cancer patients has been shown to be higher in females than males, but the behavior of distress during time in longitudinal prospective studies has not been studied, nor is it known if there are differences related to gender during time.

At the end of the session, the distress thermometer and ESAS-r scale are compiled together with the demographic characteristics. All outstanding issues that are relevant to the therapeutic plan are then discussed between the psychotherapist and the medic before the oncology visit together with delivery of the DT and ESASr scale result.",

Additionally, the patient is prompted to identify sources of distress using a 39-item supplemental list of potential sources of distress, including the following domains: emotional, physical, practical, family, and spiritual/religious problems. DT scores are categorized in three levels, 0-3, low, 4-6, moderate, 7-10, severe.
