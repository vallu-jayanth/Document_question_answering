This is defined as the proportion of eligible patients treated without a major protocol deviation. Secondary endpoints include radiation toxicity, cosmetic outcome, quality of life, time to ipsilateral breast recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival.\n\nPrimary objectives: To evaluate the technical feasibility and reproducibility of APBI limited to the region of the tumour bed using 3D CRT following breast conserving surgery.\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\nTo assess the acute and long term toxicity of APBI using 3D CRT.\nTo examine the cosmetic outcome of women with breast cancer treated by breast conserving surgery and APBI using 3D CRT.\nTo determine the time to ipsilateral breast recurrence, disease free survival and overall survival of women with node-negative breast cancer completely resected by breast conserving surgery followed by APBI using 3D CRT.\nTo assess the quality of life of women with node-negative breast cancer treated by breast conserving surgery and APBI using 3D CRT."
