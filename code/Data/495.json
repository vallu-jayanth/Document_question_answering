This study aims to learn:\n\nHow the treatment affects emotional and social well-being.\nHow a new sexual health educational program affects you.\n\nCancer patients seek education for lots of reasons. It often helps them cope because they can express their feelings with a trained professional. This study is open to individuals who have been treated for rectal, colorectal or anal cancer. It involves a new type of sexual health counseling program. It will teach participants skills that they can use to improve their sex lives. These skills may also improve physical and emotional well-being. We will compare the new type of sexual health program with the standard care patients receive after treatment for rectal, colorectal or anal cancer.",
