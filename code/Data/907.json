                "DetailedDescription": "Laparoscopic gastric cancer surgery has the advantages of less trauma, quick postoperative recovery, less postoperative pain symptoms, less postoperative complications, and shorter average hospital stay. In addition, the surgical safety and oncological efficacy of laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer have been obtained. Confirmed by numerous clinical studies.\n\nHowever, due to the difficult operation, complex anatomy and high technical requirements of laparoscopic gastric cancer surgery, the operator needs to have rich experience in laparotomy, skilled laparoscopic operation skills, and the ability to actively prevent and deal with complications after surgery. Therefore, at this stage, laparoscopic radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer is only suitable for large hospitals with certain conditions, and it should be gradually carried out on the basis of chief surgeons with rich clinical experience in radical gastrectomy and skilled laparoscopic technical experience.\n\nThe gastric cancer specialist training program (STP-LRG-1) of Fujian Medical University Affiliated Union Hospital (STP-LRG-1) has more than 9 years of trainee training experience. The effectiveness of STP-LRG-1 has not been prospectively evaluated, so this study aimed to prospectively evaluate whether STP-LRG-1 can improve the surgical skills of trainees and ultimately improve short-term outcomes for patients during and after surgery"
