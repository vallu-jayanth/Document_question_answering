At the end of the treatment, these recordings will be exported in an anonymized way and analyzed according to the 3 different methods.\n\nA multiparametric-MRI will be performed in addition to the usual practice within 5 days after the treatment in order to control the area necroticised by the treatment. The mp-MRI will be the reference method against which the results obtained by the 3 methods of ultrasound image analysis will be compared.\n\nTechniques capable of providing safe and robust information on the progress of HIFU-generated necrosis would greatly limit the risks of overtreatment that can lead to side effects such as urinary incontinence as well as the risks of under treatment that can lead to cancer recurrence."
