Rural communities face unique barriers in implementation of evidence-based interventions due to a lack of infrastructure, community capacity, and expertise as academic and research centers are often clustered in urban areas. The support program may help a rural community-based organization select, adapt, and implement cancer prevention and control evidence-based interventions.",

The current USPSTF recommendations for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer are:\n\nBreast Cancer Screening: Women ages 50-74 should be screened for breast cancer with mammography every 2 years.\nCervical Cancer Screening: Women ages 21-29 should be screened for cervical cancer every 3 years with cervical cancer cytology alone. For women ages 30-65, the USPSTF recommends screening every 3 years with cervical cytology alone, every 5 years or every 5 years with high risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing in combination of cytology.\nColorectal Cancer Screening: Individuals ages 50-75 should be screened for colorectal cancer with guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (gFOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) once a year, or colonoscopy every 10 years (USPSTF approves additional screening tests, but these are the most commonly used).\nObjective III PARTICIPANTS: If the community-based organization selects breast cancer screening, we will recruit women ages 50-74.\nObjective III PARTICIPANTS: If the community-based organization selects cervical cancer screening, we will recruit women ages 21-65.\nObjective III PARTICIPANTS: If the community-based organization selects colorectal cancer screening, we will recruit women and men ages 50-75.\nObjective III PARTICIPANTS: Average risk for breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer",
