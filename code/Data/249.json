                "DetailedDescription": "Colorectal Cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in the USA and the world's fourth most deadly cancer .the incidence and the mortality rate of colorectal cancer has decreased due to effective cancer screening measures.\n\nBesides an ageing population and dietary habits of high-income countries, unfavourable risk factors such as obesity, lack of physical exercise, and smoking increase the risk of colorectal cancer.\n\nThe incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer diagnosed in patients under the age of 50 years- has been increasing around the world.\n\nThe insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system composed of two ligands, their receptors and regulatory proteins.\n\nIGFBPs regulate the cell cycle, and the function of IGFBPs in transcriptional regulation, DNA damage repair and apoptosis induction suggest that they are closely associated with tumour development, progression, and therapy resistance.\n\nInsulin-like growth factor peptides play important roles in regulating cell growth, cell differentiation, and apoptosis, and have been demonstrated to promote the development of colorectal cancer.\n\nResearchers found that IGFBP3 has the potential to be used as early indicator for colorectal cancer diagnosis.\n\nMoreover, IGFBP3 as a risk factor for carcinogenesis has been demonstrated in many cancers.\n\nIGFBP3 as a tumour suppressor was reported to be down-regulated in some cancers. But some other publications showed its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis for several cancers including pancreatic endocrine neoplasms.\n\nMeanwhile, epidemiological studies indicated that higher circulating IGFBP3 level were an increased risk of breast cancer."
