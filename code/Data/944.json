Patients will be recruited within 6 weeks of completing their last definitive breast cancer therapy (radiation or chemotherapy). Patients will complete self administered baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Following baseline evaluation patients will be randomized to receiving either written information for follow-up care of cancer survivors published by the National Cancer Institute (Facing Forward), or the Survivorship Intervention. Patients will not be aware that they are participating in a randomized intervention. After verbally agreeing to participate they will be randomized to group A or B and will receive the corresponding consent. Patients will be re-assessed 3 and 6 months after enrollment."
