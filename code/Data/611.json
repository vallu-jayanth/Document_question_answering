                "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to pilot test a transdisciplinary intervention that integrates both geriatrics and palliative care with routine oncology care for older adults with incurable cancer. The investigators will explore their perceptions of the supportive care needs of older patients with cancer. Using these data, the investigators will finalize the transdisciplinary intervention and perform a pilot, randomized trial of the transdisciplinary intervention versus usual care in patients age \u226565 with newly diagnosed, incurable cancer.",
                "DetailedDescription": "While evidence suggests that older adults with incurable cancer have unique geriatric and palliative care needs, models of care that are focused on these needs are lacking. The investigators propose to pilot test an intervention targeting the geriatric and palliative care needs of older adults with incurable cancer, referred to as a \"transdisciplinary intervention.\"\n\nThe goals of the proposed study are: (1) conduct focus groups with clinicians (from oncology, geriatrics and palliative care) and interviews with patients to explore their perceptions of older patients' supportive care needs and finalize the transdisciplinary intervention; (2) to demonstrate the feasibility and acceptability of delivering the transdisciplinary intervention to older patients with incurable GI and lung cancers; and (3) to estimate the effect size of the transdisciplinary intervention for patient-reported outcomes (e.g., between-group differences from baseline to week 12 in quality of life, physical function, physical and psychological symptoms)."
