                "BriefSummary": "This research study will test a new online computer program for patients, the Electronic Self-Report Assessment-Cancer (ESRA-C 2). The program allows patients to report symptoms and quality of life issues and learn information about how to deal with these experiences. The computer program is being tested to see if it can improve communications between patients and their care team and if it can improve patients' experiences during and after treatment.",
                "DetailedDescription": "This study includes two groups of participants: 1) Clinician Participants and 2) Patient Participants.\nPatient participants will have already completed one ESRA-C 2 report, which is a usual report in the clinic. If they decide to participate in the study, that report will be used in the study as the first report (Timepoint 1). In addition, they will complete a second report (Timepoint 2) and two more reports (Timepoint 3 and 4). Timepoint 3 will be 6-8 weeks after the participants treatment begins; Timepoint 4 will be 2-4 weeks after their treatment ends.\nThe Timepoint 2 report will be within 24 hours before a clinic visit. The conversation between the patient participant and the health care providers will be audio recorded.\nHalf of the patient participants will also see additional information in the computer program. The patient participants that are in this group can complete as many more ESRA-C 2 reports as they wish and will be able to read additional information about managing symptoms and quality of life issues, view graphs of their reports, add journal entries, and share all their reports with caregivers.\nClinician Participants will be asked to report brief demographics (age group, gender, race/ethnicity, position). During clinic appointments, research staff will place a 3\" by 5\" audio-recorder in the exam room just prior to some of the participant's visits. Recordings will be de-identified before coding.\nAfter these visits, a research staff member will ask the clinician participant to report briefly on their satisfaction in the visit. The participant can check their responses on a piece of paper or dictate them."
