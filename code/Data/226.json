The investigators will establish organoids from the pre-treatment biopsies. Organoids will be exposed to the chemotherapy drugs or chemotherapy drugs combined with cetuximab used for each patient. The sensitivity of chemotherapy drugs or combined cetuximab will be tested in the organoids model. Chemotherapy strategies including 5-fluorouracil only, irinotecan only, oxaliplatin only, FOLFOX, and FOLFIRI. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the consistency and accuracy of a Patient-Derived Organoid (PDO) model of colon cancer to predict the clinical efficacy of combined treatment of cetuximab, which to formulate the best therapy regimen for each given patient.",

The medication regime and treatment cycle will be decided based on the clinical guideline and evidence-based medicine.\nThe patient-derived organoid-based drug sensitivity test will compare with clinical treatment data of chemotherapy or chemotherapy combined target therapy, followed by correlation analysis."
