                "BriefSummary": "Because one cancer type may harbor various genetic aberrations, it is not enough to check only one or a few genes for a patient to choose the adequate treatment. Because the advance in multiplex genomic testing, several NGS-based cancer-associated genetic panel tests (oncopanel) have been developed and used to identify the genetic alterations, particularly the actionable genes, in each patient. Large scale checks of oncopanel have been executed in US. The study showed the genetic alterations in various cancer types and 11% of the patients had further molecular targeted therapy based on the result of the oncopanel test. Similar program was also conducted in Japan. Moreover, the oncopanel tests have been implicated in their clinical practice and the cost was reimbursed by the government of Japan and Korea recently. Precision medicine and such personalized treatment is the trend of cancer treatment. The trend of such treatment patterns is also observed in Taiwan. The genetic background for cancer treatment may also be different among different areas and races. There is short of genetic alteration data in Taiwanese cancer patients. To understand the landscape of genetic aberrations of cancer in Taiwan, large scale survey of the cancer patients is indicated. investigators propose to evaluate the landscape of genetic aberrations in cancer patients via oncopaenl test and collect the clinical data of the patients. The result of the oncopanel test will be provided to patients and their attending physicians as reference for their further treatment. In addition, investigators want to correlate the clinical outcome with the genetic aberrations of the cancer patients in Taiwan. Thyroid cancers are divided into differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), medullary and anaplastic carcinoma. The majority of the patients are DTC. Different from other cancer type, radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy is usually the main treatment for advanced DTC. Multitargeted kinase inhibitors are indicated for advanced DTC refractory to RAI therapy and advanced medullary thyroid cancer. For anaplastic thyroid cancer, the prognosis is poor in spite of chemotherapy or radiation therapy. BRAF or NTRK targeted therapies are suggested if the patients have these genetic aberrations. Thyroid cancer patients have various genetic aberrations, including BRAF, RAS, RET, NTRK and others. Various gene specific kinase inhibitors have been developed and demonstrated the efficacy for the treatment of advanced thyroid cancer in addition to current standard therapies. Thyroid cancer is a cancer type with high percentage of driver gene aberration, however the genetic landscape of thyroid cancer is not well understood in Taiwan. In the current study, investigators want to investigate the genetic aberrations of advanced thyroid cancers by performing the NGS oncopanel.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Cancer is the most common cause of death in Taiwan since 1982. The incidence of cancer is increasing worldwide, including Taiwan. Cancers in early stage can usually be treated by surgery with a good prognosis. However, the prognosis for recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic cancers is poor with a shorter survival. Systemic treatments are usually indicated for these patients. Chemotherapy is the mainstay for advanced cancer patients. However, the advances in the understanding of cancer biology and identification of targeted therapeutics not only increase the treatment strategies of cancer but also improve the survival and quality of life of the cancer patients. There are more and more molecularly targeted therapy developed and approved for the treatment of advanced cancer patients currently, which makes the beginning of precision cancer medicine. There are more and more treatments can be used based on the genetic aberrations of the cancers. Because one cancer type may harbor various genetic aberrations, it is not enough to check only one or a few genes for a patient to choose the adequate treatment.
