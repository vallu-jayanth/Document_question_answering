To develop and pilot test in an uncontrolled fashion an in-visit English and Spanish language decision aid for Hispanic-Latino men using best practices of cultural tailoring to be used in urology practice ii. To pilot and test the impact of a culturally tailored, English and Spanish language version of the Prostate Choice in-visit decision aid on decision quality, knowledge, and quality of life in low-income Hispanic/Latino patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer iii. To assess the barriers and facilitators of decision aid use including the relative contribution of language-concordance on 1-year practice implementation parameters."
