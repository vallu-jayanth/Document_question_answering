This study will address this knowledge gap. Early detection is vital in the fight against skin cancer, the most common cancer in the United States. While the effects of skin cancer can be devastating, this disease is highly treatable when detected early.\n\nThis study evaluates the impact of the AAD SPOTme\u00ae skin cancer screening events on attendees' skin cancer prevention and detection behaviors.
