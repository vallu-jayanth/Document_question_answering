Researchers also want to find out if Prostaphane is safe and tolerable, and to evaluate how Prostaphane works to reduce the progression of bladder cancer. This study will compare Prostaphane with a placebo to see if taking Prostaphane is better than taking a placebo. A placebo is a pill that looks like Prostaphane but has no drug or other active ingredients in it.\n\nThe study will be presented to eligible patients by the patient's surgeon at the time when an appointment is made for cystoscopy for suspicion of bladder cancer (BC) or to confirm BC diagnosis.",

The study will be conducted during the time from when the participant is diagnosed with bladder cancer to when they undergo a surgical procedure for the treatment or removal of their bladder cancer. The surgical procedure is done as a part of their regular medical care. Participants will be asked to come for 1 additional visit as part of this research study at the midpoint between their biopsy and surgery."
