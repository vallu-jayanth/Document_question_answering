Following tumor genetic profiling, subjects will be screened for eligibility. Eligible subjects' cases will be evaluated by the Dartmouth Cancer Center Molecular Tumor Board, and treatment recommendations will be entered into the medical record as per standard procedure.\n\nThe primary endpoint is a survey response from the treating physician indicating how Molecular Tumor Board evaluation impacted treatment decisions. Secondary endpoints include: 1) Molecular Tumor Board treatment recommendation; 2) disease progression on line of therapy started after MTB recommendations were made. Surveys will be administered approximately 3 and 12 months after Molecular Tumor Board recommendations are made."

(the list of genetic alterations evolves as new information emerges and new drugs are developed); (B) an alteration suspected to be germline.\nSubject must have ECOG Performance Status of 0 to 2.\nSubject must have measurable or evaluable disease.\nSubjects who have previously enrolled in this study can be enrolled a second time if they undergo genetic profiling of a tumor that was biopsied/sampled AFTER progression on an intervening line of treatment started after the time of first enrollment. Re-enrollment of such subjects must be noted in REDCap to facilitate longitudinal analysis.\nAge \u226518 years.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nSubjects with a tumor harboring a genetic alteration for which an FDA-approved drug is indicated that the patient has not yet received (example for exclusion: a melanoma with a BRAF-V600E mutation in a subject who has not yet been treated with a BRAF inhibitor).\nPregnant women.",
