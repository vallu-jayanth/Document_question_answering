Radiation is an effective treatment for destroying tumors. It is widely used in cancer treatment. However, radiation can harm normal tissue. SIR-Spheres are tiny plastic beads. They contain a radioactive agent called Yttrium-90. These beads can be delivered through a small tube inserted into the blood vessel that goes directly to the tumor. The radiation goes directly to the tumor. This spares healthy parts of your liver."
