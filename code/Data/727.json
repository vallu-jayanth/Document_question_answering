Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the drug is being studied. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved rogaratinib as a treatment for any disease.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are studying rogaratinib in bladder cancer that has not responded to BCG and overexpresses a protein called FGFR1 or 3.\n\nMutations in FGFR help bladder cancer grow. In metastatic cancers that express FGFR 1 or 3, rogaratinib and other inhibitors of FGFR have shown to be an effective treatment\nRogaratinib is an oral drug that inhibits FGFR\nTo date, no therapy has been shown to be effective in controlling bladder cancer after BCG does not work."

No data are available to evaluate the interaction between rogaratinib and radiation. Therefore, when administering these agents after study drug has been withdrawn, it should be taken into consideration that rogaratinib plasma concentrations may be detectable for a few days (depending on half-life) and the physiologic consequences that could interact with chemotherapy and radiotherapy may last even longer following discontinuation of rogaratinib.",
