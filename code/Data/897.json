                "DetailedDescription": "Breast cancer diagnosis is a rapidly expanding research field, whose early-stage detection may reduce the burden of the disease and permit more effective treatment. It is well documented that tumor growth requires specific conditions for its development from the occurrence of a mutation to a clinically detectable cancer. It has been shown that living peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) have different ability of cytosolic enzymes (esterases) to convert hydrophobic substrate fluorescein diacetate (FDA) into hydrophilic fluorescent fluorescein. It depends on PBMC cycle stage, size, surface state, physiological states, such as activation and apoptosis.\n\nThe important step of breast cancer genesis is the early change of functional activity of cytosolic enzymes (esterases) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Such transformations in PBMC may be detected accurately by an existing device Flowcytometer (FACS\u2122 MultiSET\u2122 System, company \"Becton Dickinson\" GmbH, USA), where measurements of fluorescence polarization and enzymatic hydrolysis of FDA substrate are recorded. A conclusion about presentation of breast cancer among examined women is achieved by \"CDT\" (cancer detection technology) software, which analyzes mathematically the results of fluorescence polarization and enzymatic hydrolysis.\n\nMoreover, the combined biochemical model together with additional prognostic parameters (such as age, ethnic group, gynecological and obstetric anamnesis) increases the validity (accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) of the diagnostic conclusion.\n\nDiagnostic Solution of the CDT:\n\nMathematical processing of specific blood analysis in device Flowcytometer.\nMathematical evaluation of specific prognostic parameters"
