Autologous T cells will be gene-engineered with the CAR gene using a retrovirus vector. Prior to T cell infusion, the patients will be subjected to preconditioning treatment. After T cell infusion, the patients will be evaluated for 24 months for adverse reactions, persistence of CAR T cells and efficacy."
