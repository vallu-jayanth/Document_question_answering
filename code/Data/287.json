Therefore, the performance of tumor molecular profiling is currently recommended by international guidelines at initial diagnosis, among other reasons, for the modification of the treatment plan. The investigators' hypothesis was that tumor molecular profiling reveals additional parameters that can improve the predictive and prognostic role of the mere presence of HRR gene mutations. The study aimed to investigate the prognostic and predictive role of clonality of pathogenic variants in HRR genes and/or concurrent pathogenic variants in other clinically relevant genes."
