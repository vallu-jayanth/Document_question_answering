                "DetailedDescription": "This is a non-interventional clinical study in which (1) cancer tissue that has been resected, biopsied, or drained due to malignant pleural effusion and that is left remaining after (or is not being used during) a pathology investigation and, where possible, (2) a vial of the same patient's blood is sent to Known Medicine Inc. for placement into organoids and subsequent tumor drug sensitivity measurement.\n\nPatients will be consented prior to performance of a medically indicated and pre-planned surgical procedure during which at least a 1cm3 piece of tumor tissue or >100 mL pleural effusion fluid and blood in a separate vial are obtained. These samples will be sent after removal to Known Medicine Inc. from the hospital using a kit provided by Known Medicine. Within the Known Medicine provided kit a data form, freezer pack and containers for the specimens will be provided.\n\nIf a solid tissue sample, the tissue will be washed and subsequently digested into a single cell solution using enzymatic digestion methods. Cells will be sorted into cancer and stromal cell populations, stained fluorescently with intramembrane stain, and placed into a 3D cell culture matrix within a multi-well plate. Cells may also be genetically sequenced.\n\nIf an aspirated fluid sample, cells will be separated from the fluid and further sorted into cancer cell populations.\n\nCultures will be allowed to sustain themselves for 48 hours, at which point standard of care chemotherapeutic or other FDA approved drug treatments will be administered. After 72 hours, control and treated wells will be imaged using fluorescence and cell phenotype will be evaluated. Media from cultures may also be evaluated. After imaging, media will be removed and a metabolic assay will be performed to determine culture viability. Using the described quantitative outcomes, tumor sensitivity to each of the administered treatments will be determined.\n\nPatients will be followed and their response to treatment and outcome information from the hospital will be obtained which will allow retrospective validation of tumor organoid sensitivity."
