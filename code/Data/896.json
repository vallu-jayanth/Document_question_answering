Therefore, breath samples (BS) of patients are collected. Five sniffer dogs are trained to distinguish between the BS of patients with lung cancer and healthy individuals (controls). In a prospective, randomized blinded study the dog's ability to differentiate between BS of i) patients with lung cancer, ii) patients with inflammatory airway disease, but no evidence of cancer and iii) healthy individuals is tested.",
                "DetailedDescription": "All breath samples (BS) are collected in patients on the basis of radiologic findings before any intervention (bronchoscopy, biopsy or surgery) has been performed. The allocation to study groups is made following diagnostic work up and surgery.\n\nThree study groups are defined using the following inclusion and exclusion criteria:\n\nlung cancer: male & female, age 18-80, competent, confirmed lung cancer in diagnostic work up and surgery, no history or present other tumor disease\nhealthy individual: male & female, age 18-80, competent, no history or present other tumor disease including lung cancer, no pathological lung function tests\nchronic obstructive lung disease: male & female, age 18-80, competent, no history or present other tumor disease including lung cancer, pathological lung function tests\n\nFor each patient, i) history, ii) present medication, iii) lung function tests are documented. For the lung cancer patients, the tumor stage following surgery is documented.\n\nFive sniffer dogs are trained using BS of lung cancer patients and healthy individuals. After completion of the training the ability of the dogs to differentiate between the groups is tested:\n\n5 BS are presented in 1 experiment:\n\nTest I: lung cancer vs healthy individual\nTest II: lung cancer vs chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nTest III: lung cancer vs healthy individuals & bronchitis\n\nfor every experiment 1 BS of a lung cancer patient is used\n\nthe lung cancer sample is placed randomly in one of the five test tubes\nthe other test tubes are used for BS of healthy individuals or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients or both\nneither the dog handler nor the dog know the loading of the test tubes\nexperiments are repeated 5 to 10 times\n\nFor analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of the dog's reaction is determined.\n\nThe patient's medication, smoking habits, age and gender are analysed to rule out confounders or bias."
