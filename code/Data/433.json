To do so, the investigators plan to collect tumor tissue and peripheral blood samples before and after immunotherapy, and use single-cell RNA sequencing, Multiplex immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry. The investigators will analyze changes in the proportion of cancer cell-specific T-cell subpopulations related to treatment response before and after therapy, and seek biological markers that can predict the efficacy of immunotherapy.",
                "DetailedDescription": "The potential biomarkers, that can be utilized to predict the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, in tumor tissue and peripheral blood are planning to be verified in lung cancer patients and esophageal cancer patients. Tumor tissues, acquired from surgery to remove tumor, are investigated by single-cell RNA sequencing, Multiplex immunohistochemistry etc. to explore the biomarkers. In addition, immune microenvironment of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analyzed by flow cytometry and ELISPOT to quantify specific T cells groups that are correlated with efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. The changes in the proportion of specific T-cell subpopulations that can kill cancer cells will be analyzed before treatment and after treatment. The immunotherapy responses before and after therapy are planning to analyzed with the content of specific T cells. Thus the investigators will seek biological markers that can predict the efficacy of immunotherapy."
