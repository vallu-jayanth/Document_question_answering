                "BriefSummary": "The goal of this clinical research study is to find out if men who have a type of prostate cancer that has been classified as \"low risk\" can safely not be treated for the disease. Doctors want to know if patients with \"low risk\" cancer can avoid or postpone therapy and the related side effects and still live as long as patients who immediately receive therapy.\n\nThis is an investigational study. There are no medications used in this trial.\n\nAbout 1,000 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.",
                "DetailedDescription": "You have an early stage of prostate cancer that can be treated effectively with surgery or radiation. If you choose to take part in this study, you will be agreeing to receive only active surveillance. Active surveillance is an investigational way to manage low-stage small volume prostate cancer. While on active surveillance, you will have no treatment for the prostate cancer. However, you will have repeated Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) tests, physical exams, and other testing to detect when the cancer is becoming a greater risk which may require you to begin treatment.\n\nIf you agree to participate in this study, you will not have standard therapy for prostate cancer. Your diagnosis will be confirmed as being of low risk by tests at MD Anderson. Blood will be drawn for PSA tests at the beginning of the study and every 6 months to monitor your cancer.\n\nYou will have a biopsy of the prostate at the beginning of the study. Additional prostate biopsies will be performed at your first repeat biopsy at Year 1, and when a doctor thinks it is necessary.\n\nYou will have digital rectal examination every 6 months to see if your doctor can feel any prostate nodules. You will have a transrectal ultrasonography every 12 months to see if your doctor can detect any abnormalities in the prostate.\n\nAdditionally, you will fill out 7 surveys at the beginning of the study and again every 6 months about how you are coping with the disease and the quality of your life. Each survey will take 5 to 10 minutes to complete.\n\nWhile you are on study, if an exam or test results show that your disease is getting worse, you will be given the opportunity to have treatment to remove the cancer. If you do choose to receive treatment, you will be taken off study and continue to receive standard follow-up.\n\nLong-Term Follow-Up:\n\nEvery 12 months, the study staff will review your medical record or you will be called or e-mailed and asked how you are doing. If you are called, the call would only last a few minutes.\n\nThis is an investigational study. About 1,000 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
