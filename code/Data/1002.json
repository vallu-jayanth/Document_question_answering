                "BriefSummary": "RATIONALE: Women may stay up-to-date with cancer screening if a health professional helps them overcome barriers to screening, including helping them to schedule cancer screening appointments.\n\nPURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the use of health professional-tailored telephone support compared with usual care from their personal doctor to help women overcome barriers to screening for colorectal, cervical, and breast cancer.",
                "DetailedDescription": "OBJECTIVES:\n\nPrimary\n\nDevelop and evaluate an enhanced telephone support intervention (Prevention Care Manager [PCM]) to promote colorectal, cervical, and breast cancer screening more widely among women enrolled in a Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MMCO).\nExplore the impact of patient, Community/Migrant Health Center (C/MHC), and MMCO characteristics on cancer screening status and the impact of the intervention.\nEvaluate the impact of the enhanced PCM intervention upon colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer screening rates.\n\nSecondary\n\nCompare the status of women who are up-to-date (UTD) on CRC screening versus the UTD status of cervical cancer and breast cancer screening.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled study. The study is conducted in 2 parts.\n\nPart 1 (barrier interview and pilot testing): Patients are stratified according to primary language and whether or not they have had an outpatient visit in the past year.\n\nBarrier interview: Patients undergo a 15-30 minute interview to determine barriers they face preventing them from receiving recommended cancer screenings and healthcare, as well as facilitators which have encouraged them to be screened.\nPilot testing: Patients from the barrier interviews and other eligible Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MMCO) patients receive scripted telephone calls from a Prevention Care Manager to assist them in getting up-to-date on their cancer screening tests over 3 months.\n\nPart 2 (randomized control trial): Patients are stratified according to treatment center (Community/Migrant health center vs Diagnostic and Treatment Center) and age. Patient are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.\n\nArm I (Prevention Care Manager): Patients are stratified according to the number of tests for which they are up-to-date at baseline. Patients receive reminder letters encouraging them to contact their primary care provider for colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer screening and 3 to 4 telephone support calls to help them become up to date for colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer screening.\nArm II (usual care): Patients receive usual care according to their primary care physician.\n\nIn both arms, patients are followed for 18 months.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,600 patients will be accrued for this study."
