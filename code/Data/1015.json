After their enrolment, participants will receive a hyperlink via email to invite them to complete a baseline questionnaire.\n\nAfter completing the baseline questionnaire, participants will be randomly assigned by a research assistant to the digital educational intervention (Cannabis & Cancer) or to a control group (official public websites and scientific articles).\n\nFour weeks after the baseline questionnaire, participants will complete the online questionnaires again."

To this end, various pedagogical modalities that encourage the active participation of nurses are integrated into the training (eg, interactive videos, and quizzes). Scientific articles and links to external resources (official public websites) are also included so that nurses can consult the content at their own pace. Different aspects related to the use of cannabis are addressed in the training (eg, beneficial effects, and potential side effects).",
