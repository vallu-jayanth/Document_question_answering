This part of the samples should have relevant previous molecular diagnosis results.\nAble to provide samples in time according to the requirements of the plan: samples for DNA/RNA extraction: 10 pieces of 10 \u00b5m thickness for each sample or 10 pieces of paraffin rolls. Samples for FISH experiment: 5 slices of 3-4\u00b5m thickness.\nThe pathological examination conforms to the types of tissue samples listed in the above table. The HE staining results show that the tumor content is not less than 50%, and the paraffin slice damage should be avoided.\nThe sample should have corresponding basic clinical information, including: patient visiting number/medical record number/specimen number, age, gender, pathological diagnosis result, molecular diagnosis result (if any).\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nThose who do not meet any of the above conditions are excluded. Reason: The included non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma samples and normal samples should have statistical significance, and the conclusions obtained should be scientific and valid. The selection of subjects for this study, while excluding research-related influencing factors, has no adverse effect on the health of the subjects.",
