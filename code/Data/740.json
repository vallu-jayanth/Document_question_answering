Since breast cancer survivors have been reported to have trouble with their memory, a program to help these problems is important. Studies have shown that a 5-week software training program improved memory in pediatric cancer survivors and other disorders like stroke, but it has not been tested for breast cancer survivors. This study will see if breast cancer survivors can improve their memory and attention problems by using either one of two software versions of the program. One version is called Cogmed Working Memory Training, and the other is a comparison version of the software that has the same exercises but is less difficult. People who decide to participate in the study will be randomly given one of the two versions."

For each group, training occurs for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week for 5 weeks. As part of the set-up, training data is uploaded to the internet at a minimum of every 3 days. This function allows the \"coach\" (in this case, the PI and RSA) to review the training. A weekly \"coach\" phone call is made to review the training results, answer questions, troubleshoot, and motivate the participant. Participants can load the software onto multiple computers to provide flexibility for them to do training at home, after work, when they are away from home.",

The software was developed and validated in English and are not currently available in other languages. Translation of questionnaires into other languages would require reestablishing the reliability and validity of these measures.\nMust demonstrate cognitive deficiency, which is defined as 1.0 standard deviations below normative data on at least one of the pre-screen phone assessments (WAIS-III Digit Span, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, Controlled Oral Word Association Test, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test) or must have 1.0 standard deviations difference from the pre-morbid estimate of cognitive functioning, Wide Range Achievement Test 4: Reading subtest, and one of the pre-screen phone assessment measures.\nMust have basic computer skills such as able to turn on a computer, open the program, login, and use a mouse.\nParticipants must have the ability to upload their data via the internet. A study laptop can be loaned out to participants who do not have a computer or the appropriate operating systems.\n\nCollateral Participant (if such person is available to the participant, not a requirement of the study) Family member or friend (i.e., collateral) identified by a patient who has at least weekly face to face contact with the patient\n\nCollateral person is at least 18 years of age\nFamily member or friend has adequate English fluency for completion of data collection. The surveys were designed and validated in English and are not currently available in other languages. Translation of questionnaires into other languages would require reestablishing the reliability and validity of these measures.\nAble to provide informed consent\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPatients\n\nHistory of neurological disorder with cognitive symptoms (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, seizure disorder) as per self report or as documented in the electronic medical record.\nHistory of mental retardation, learning disorder bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, substance use disorder(s), or uncontrolled depression as per self report or as documented in the medical record.\nHistory of Traumatic Brain Injury with > or = to 30 minutes loss of consciousness or cognitive sequelae as per self report or as documented in the medical record.\nHistory of Stroke as per self report or as documented in the medical record.\nPrior history or secondary diagnosis of other cancers except for basal cell carcinoma or melanoma treated with surgery only\nHistory of multiple courses of chemotherapy.\nEvidence of recurrence at time of screening\nA hearing or visual deficit that impairs the ability to use the software.\nSignificant cognitive or psychiatric disturbance sufficient, in the investigator's judgment, to preclude providing informed consent.\nMales will be excluded as only a minority of men gets breast cancer.
