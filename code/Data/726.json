                "BriefSummary": "Most cancer-related deaths are caused by distant metastases, which are tumour cells that have escaped from a primary tumour and passed into the bloodstream to colonize a new organ. In this context, communication between tumour and stromal cells is essential. Indeed, tumor cells interact with cells in the tumor microenvironment and are able to modify them to their advantage. Both extracellular vesicles (EVs) and exosomes are heterogeneous populations of small vesicles present in the tumor microenvironment and in body fluids that have recently emerged as powerful mediators involved in this communication and their transport in fluids. Tumor cells release large quantities of exosomes containing tumor markers, which can then spread to distant locations.\n\nThe exosomes are of endosomal origin. They are composed of proteins, lipids, RNA and DNA, and they circulate in the bloodstream. They can be internalized by specific distant cells and thus deliver a functional message. It has recently been shown that tumor exosomes containing pro-metastatic factors form pre-metastatic niches, before the tumor cells actually arrive, while determining the metastatic organotropism of tumors. These properties are now opening up new avenues of research in tumor biomarkers. In recent years, several studies have highlighted different markers contained specifically in exosomes derived from cancer cells. Consequently, exosomes are considered as potential reservoirs of tumor biomarkers that could be clinically useful for the non-invasive diagnosis of cancer, with the advantage of being performed by liquid biopsy. The study of microRNA (miRNA) is of particular interest. Indeed, miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs (between 21 and 25 nucleotides) involved in the regulation of gene expression and which are frequently deregulated in cancer. Several studies underline that the variation of free miRNAs in the blood is correlated with the progression of the disease, particularly in colon cancer. However, the stability of free miRNAs is controversial. Therefore, exosomes represent a very advantageous means of transporting miRNAs in the blood, as they are able to protect miRNAs from degradation by RNAase.\n\nThe hypothesis of the project is that circulating exosomes derived from tumours contain markers including specific miRNAs that could be used as biomarkers of early prognosis (survival and progression), easily measured in blood samples from patients with colon cancer. But other molecules contained in exosomes could also be of interest."
