PET/CT looks if the tumor cells are actively growing. The investigators will do these two tests and see which one is better.\n\nPatients will remain on study until the completion of either the MRI perfusion or PET/CT that are within 12 weeks of each other. After one of these scans, the patient will have no active interventions and will be off study.\n\nOptional: Restriction Spectrum Imaging (RSI) Sequence RSI sequence is an advanced way of looking at your brain. The scan allows doctors to see how water is moving within brain tumors or within brain cells. The extra sequence takes additional 4-5 minutes in the scanner. The RSI sequence is optional. The patient will only be asked to participate if the doctor believes that it will be helpful.\n\nOff study: Patients will remain on study until the completion of either the MRI perfusion or PET/CT that are within 12 weeks of each other. After one of these scans, the patient will have no active interventions and will be off study. Patients will obtain a standard of care brain MRI scan about every 2-3 months. These MRI scans will be used to track disease progression."

These scans are part of the standard of care for patients with brain tumors and uncertain tumor response or progression after treatment. Although every effort will be made to perform both MRI perfusion and PET/CT on the same day or during the same week, some patients may experience longer intervals between scans due to scheduling conflicts. The disease in question (radiation injury vs. tumor progression) may change slightly during this interval (e.g., the lesion may grow or shrink slightly), but no large changes are expected between the two scans. The patients may continue existing treatments in the interval between scans (e.g., steroids, chemotherapy), but the two scans must be performed before any change or new treatment occurs. Fusion images of MRI and PET/CT will not be reviewed by the neuroradiologist interpreting the MRI perfusion nor the nuclear medicine radiologist interpreting the PET/CT.",
