These interviews will be conducted by the UNC CHAI Core and will continue until thematic saturation (estimated 10 participants). The investigators will code the qualitative data using emerging themes, guided by a well-established implementation science theory, the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). The information gained from these studies will inform an implementation approach to increase the usability and acceptability of a novel prognostic tool to assist oncologists in the prognosis of patients with metastatic breast cancer.",
                "DetailedDescription": "If this study is successful, Investigators will implement an MBC-specific prognostic tool to help clinicians identify patients who are at high risk of death in the next 30 days. Based on the input from clinicians in this proposal, as well as additional qualitative studies with patients and families, Investigators will design an implementation protocol to inform how to use this tool in clinical practice. Rather than simply publishing a prognostic tool that may not be adopted into practice, this project aims to ensure successful implementation of an evidence-based tool into the routine care of patients with MBC. Doing so will serve as an important step towards identifying high-risk patients and connecting ort to ensure high-quality, patient-centered end-of-life care."
