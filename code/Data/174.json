The cancer targeting antigens are identified through immunostaining of patient's cancer specimens. Another goal of the study is to learn more about the persistence and function of the ex vivo manipulated antigen-specific T cells in the body.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Lung cancer is a malignancy characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. There are two main types of lung cancer, small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). In 2012, lung cancer occurred in 1.8 million people and resulted in 1.6 million deaths worldwide. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, but in relapsed cancer patients, such treatments often have limited successes.\n\nIn this study, the participant's peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected for antigen-specific T cell preparation, and/or modified using an advanced lentiviral vector system. Then the antigen-specific T cells, called engineered immune effectors (EIEs) or chimeric antigen receptor modified-T cells (CAR T), which can recognize specific molecules that are expressed by the lung cancer cells, are given back to the participant by intravenous infusion.\n\nThe purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of T cell immunotherapy targeting single or multiple cancer antigens. The lung cancer antigens include known tumor antigens such as MAGE-A1, MAGE-A4, MucI, GD2, and mesothelin, as well as novel cancer antigens. Another goal of the study is to learn more about the persistence and function of the specific CAR T cells in the body."
