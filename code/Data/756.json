Documentation may be a record of an ART prescription in the medical record, a written prescription in the name of the participant for ART, or pill bottles for ART with a label showing the participant's name;\nHIV-1 RNA detection by a licensed HIV-1 RNA assay demonstrating >1000 RNA copies/mL;\nAny licensed HIV screening antibody and/or HIV antibody/antigen combination assay confirmed by a second licensed HIV assay such as a HIV-1 Western blot confirmation or HIV rapid multispot antibody differentiation assay.\n\nNote: The term \"licensed\" refers to a kit that has been certified or licensed by an oversight body within the participating country and validated internally (e.g., U.S. FDA).\n\nWHO (World Health Organization) and CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines mandate that confirmation of the initial test result must use a test that is different from the one used for the initial assessment. A reactive initial rapid test should be confirmed by either another type of rapid assay, or an E/CIA that is based on a different antigen preparation and/or different test principle (e.g., indirect versus competitive), a Western blot, or a plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load.\n\nPatient was diagnosed with or treated for cancer within the last 5 years. Participants will qualify under one of three categories:\n\nNew, primary or recurrent diagnosis -Considering or currently receiving cancer treatment\nMetastatic or locally advanced cancer - This includes cases for which there are no current definitive therapy options for cure (i.e., inoperable) but may be considered for non-standard / non-curative therapies.\nPrior diagnosis (within 5 years), in remission - Not currently on cancer treatment other than ART or maintenance therapy.\nAge \u2265 18 years.\nParticipant presents to an AMC domestic clinical trial site for either clinical care or research.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nParticipants who do not fulfill the criteria as listed above are ineligible.",
