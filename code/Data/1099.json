                "BriefSummary": "This research study is studying a PET imaging tracer as a possible means of imaging breast cancer.\n\nThe imaging agent involved in this study is:\n\n-[11C]Martinostat (called C-eleven-Martinostat)",
                "DetailedDescription": "This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining this study imaging agent in patients who have breast cancer.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved [11C]Martinostat as an investigational tracer (a type of dye used to for radiographic imaging) in a select few research studies. The FDA has not approved this tracer for any use outside of research.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are investigating the use of a PET tracer called [11C]Martinostat in patients with breast cancer.\n\nThe purpose of the study is to take images that can measure the amount of a protein called histone deacetylase, or 'HDAC' in breast tumors. Proteins are molecules made from amino acids that perform activities in the cell for the body to function in a healthy way. Prior research suggests that HDAC levels or amounts can be altered in some breast tumors. The investigators are trying to develop a method of imaging the HDAC protein in breast tumors. This could help them to study protein changes that occur in some breast tumors, and potentially help guide treatment of breast tumors in the future.\n\nIn this study, the investigators will take the pictures of the participant's chest, including the breasts, using a PET/MRI scanner. The investigators will the study tracer, or dye, called [11C]Martinostat to make these detailed pictures.\n\n[11C]Martinostat was initially developed to image the HDAC protein within the brain, because amounts or levels of HDAC can be altered in some diseases of the brain. In these previous studies of [11C]Martinostat conducted in humans, there were no adverse events (there have been no problems). While this is not the first time [11C]Martinostat has been used in humans, it is the first study in which the investigators are using this tracer to study breast cancer."
