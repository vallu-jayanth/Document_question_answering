                "BriefSummary": "Several randomized studies have demonstrated the efficiency of lung cancer screening (LCS) on mortality rates. However, screening efficiency is related to the targeted population and the participation rate.\n\nIn France, the participation rate for breast and colon cancer screening programs is respectively 50% and 32%, which is low. Then, it appears very important to determine which factors are influencing the willingness to participate to these programs. Indeed, it will allow a better communication and we will be able to perform screening campaigns adapted to the eligible population.\n\nThe Lyon Hospital is the second university hospital in France. It is composed of 14 buildings and employed 23 000 persons. More than 160 occupations are represented. So, hospital employees look relevant to be studied for LCS program.\n\nILYAD was divided in 2 parts. The first one was completed in 2020 and goal to evaluate the number of eligible individuals among the hospital employees. About 800 persons would be eligible for LCS.\n\nThis second part of the study will evaluate the participation rate and the feasibility of the LCS program. The study will target the 800 individuals that were identified previously."
