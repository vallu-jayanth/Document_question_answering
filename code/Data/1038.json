                "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to find out how you feel about the quality of your life after having had surgery to remove your stomach tumor. Some patients continue to experience different problems after stomach surgery, even when the surgery was more than three years ago. The purpose of this study is to find out the specific things that may continue to affect patients' quality of life after a major operation.",
                "DetailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to measure the quality of life (QOL) of long-term survivors of resected gastric cancer. This cohort of long-term survivors will include patients who have no evidence of disease (NED) at least three years after having curative resection for gastric cancer. There are three main types of surgical procedures used to resect primary gastric cancer, which include proximal subtotal, distal subtotal, and total gastrectomy. Surgical management of gastric cancer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) has shifted over the years to a greater use of proximal subtotal gastrectomies than in the past; however the effects on the QOL of these patients are unknown. In this study, we propose to use the European Organization for Research Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) two-part questionnaire QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22. This instrument has been shown to be a valid and reliable QOL instrument used to assess the quality of life of patients with gastric cancer.\n\nWe will measure multiple domains of QOL including, physical, role, cognitive, and emotional functions. An additional 10-item questionnaire (MSK-10) was designed by GMT service surgeons and will be administered in order to more specifically identify certain potential issues of QOL among gastric cancer survivors. These issues include eating capabilities, work status and major life changing events. Patients will be identified using the Gastric and Mixed Tumor (GMT) Service Gastric Cancer Database. The questionnaires will be conducted via telephone interview. Establishing these QOL measurements will help to provide valuable baseline data upon which to base future clinical trials of optimal surgical techniques.\n\nOBJECTIVES AND SCIENTIFIC AIMS\n\nTo establish health related QOL using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-STO22 in gastric cancer patients who are alive and free of disease for three or more years after a proximal, distal, or total gastrectomy for gastric cancer.\nTo compare the differences in QOL scores between the three different types of gastrectomy.\nTo compare results using the EORTC QLQ-C30 with published norms established in the United States.\nTo use the MSK-10 to assess the incidence and degree of certain areas of QOL that may affect gastric cancer survivors specifically."
