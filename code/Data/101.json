                "DetailedDescription": "OBJECTIVES:\n\nTo correlate data obtained by DCE-MRI and MRS in healthy women and in women who are undergoing surgery for breast cancer with data obtained by conventional X-ray mammography, tissue proteomics, and histopathology.\nTo evaluate the impact of MRSI data on treatment planning for radiotherapy and/or surgery.\n\nOUTLINE: Healthy participants undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS) for longitudinal studies of breast imaging and spectroscopy.\n\nPatients with breast cancers undergo DCE-MRI and MRS prior to initiation of treatment (i.e., surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy). After treatment has begun, patients then undergo repeat imaging (not more than 1 per month) for follow-up assessments and longitudinal studies.\n\nBreast tissue samples are collected from patients undergoing surgery. Samples are evaluated by histopathological and proteomic analysis for correlation with DCE-MRI and MRS findings.\n\nThe study interventions are discontinued after definitive surgery is performed.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 healthy participants and 40 patients with breast cancer will be accrued for this study."
