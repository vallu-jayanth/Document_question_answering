Professional organizations provide conflicting recommendations regarding prostate cancer testing but generally agree that men learn about the risks and benefits of testing and share in decisions about testing based on their personal preferences. This study was designed to assess the effects of a decision support intervention on men's knowledge about prostate cancer testing, participation in medical decisions about testing, decision conflict related to testing, and the congruence between prostate cancer testing intentions and behaviors. A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Participants were randomized into one of two conditions: (a) tailored telephone education about prostate cancer testing (intervention group) or (b) tailored telephone education about national guidelines for fruit and vegetable consumption (attention control group)."
