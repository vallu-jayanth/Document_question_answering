                "BriefSummary": "The purpose of the Ohio Colorectal Cancer Prevention Initiative (OCCPI) is to reduce morbidity and mortality due to colorectal cancer (CRC) in the state of Ohio. By identifying individuals at high-risk for CRC (genetically predisposed) and providing screening recommendations for cancer risk reduction, the OCCPI will understand how to increase length of life and quality of life for those diagnosed with CRC in Ohio, as well as to better prevent CRC in others in Ohio.\n\nParticipants will have free tumor screening for Lynch syndrome, and may be eligible for free genetic testing and free genetic counseling as part of this study.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Lynch Syndrome:\n\nLynch syndrome (LS), previously known as \"hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer\", is a hereditary cancer syndrome that causes the majority of hereditary CRC and approximately 3% of all CRC. LS significantly increases the risk for an individual to develop CRC during their lifetime. Individuals with LS also have an increased risk to develop extracolonic cancers, including endometrial, gastric, ovarian, upper urinary tract, small bowel, biliary tract, CNS, and certain types of skin cancer. Tumor studies, including microsatellite instability (MSI) testing and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis, provide information regarding characteristic features of LS-associated tumors and can help target genetic testing. Given the hereditary nature of this syndrome, screening all patients who are newly diagnosed with CRC for LS can identify additional individuals who are at high-risk of developing cancer.\n\nStudy Aims:\n\nBy developing a CRC research infrastructure within the state of Ohio, the OCCPI will achieve the following specific aims:\n\nEstablish and implement a statewide universal screening protocol for LS.\nElucidate the prevalence of hereditary CRC in Ohio.\nProvide screening recommendations for high-risk individuals with CRC and their families, as well as local access to genetic counseling.\nCreate a CRC biorepository for future research on the etiology of CRC from the leftover samples of the CRC patients, as well as samples from their relatives.\n\nWith the successful implementation of the OCCPI, knowledge will be gained that will facilitate the adoption of a universal screening protocol for LS in Ohio and the creation of a statewide CRC biorepository to be used for additional studies on cancer risks, prevention, screening, treatment and survivorship.\n\nStudy Procedures for CRC and EC participants:\n\nYou will be asked to donate 2-3 tablespoons of blood.\nA small piece of your colorectal or endometrial tumor will be obtained from the hospital where you had your surgery.\nYou will be asked to contribute your leftover samples (tumor and blood) to the OCCPI biorepository (sample bank) for help with future research. Additionally, CRC participants will be asked to donate a saliva sample to the OCCPI biorepository. The samples will be kept securely in a lab at OSU. Before your samples can be used for research, the people doing the research must get specific approval from the OCCPI Steering Committee and possibly the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of OSU. The IRB is responsible for protecting the participants involved in research studies and making sure all research is done in a safe and ethical manner.\nYou will be asked to complete a questionnaire which will ask about your age, medical history, family history, lifestyle factors and environmental exposures. It should take about one hour to complete the questionnaire and you can complete it from home.\nWe will test your tumor for features of LS (MSI, IHC, methylation).\nFor CRC patients: if your tumor shows features of LS OR you were diagnosed under age 50 OR you have a family history of CRC or endometrial cancer OR you have synchronous or metachronous CRC or endometrial cancer, we will test your blood for the genes that cause LS, as well as other genes that can cause hereditary cancer.\nFor endometrial cancer patients: if your tumor shows features of LS, we will test your blood for the genes that cause LS, as well as other genes that can cause hereditary cancer.\nSome patients may have tumor genetic testing.\nIf you are found to have LS or another type of hereditary cancer, you will be offered free genetic counseling.\nIf you are found to have LS, your at-risk relatives will be offered free genetic counseling and genetic testing.\n\nStudy Procedures for first-degree relatives (FDR) of the CRC participants:\n\nThe FDRs of all of the CRC study participants will be given the opportunity to contribute to the biorepository for future research.\n\nFamily Member Consent for Contact forms will be provided to the CRC participant at the time of their enrollment for them to distribute to all of their FDRs (parents, siblings and adult children \u2265 25 years). The FDRs will mail the signed form to OSU.\nAfter obtaining permission to contact the FDRs, OSU will mail them the biorepository consent form and saliva kit to return to the OCCPI biorepository.\nThe FDRs of the CRC study participants will also be invited to complete the baseline questionnaire.\n\nLength of study:\n\nThe LS tumor screening portion of the OCCPI will take 1-4 months.\nIf applicable, genetic testing results should be ready in an additional 3-6 months.\nOverall, your participation in the LS screening portion of the OCCPI is expected to take about 1 year. Most of this time will be spent waiting for results. Your active involvement will take about 15 minutes on the day that you provide consent and about 60 minutes when you complete the questionnaire from home."

If only metastatic CRC is available on a biopsy (liver or lymph node metastases), tumor screening will be attempted on the metastatic tissue.\nNewly diagnosed with endometrial cancer (any histology except sarcoma) and have a resection between 1/1/2013 and 12/31/2016 at OSU only.\nAll at-risk relatives of the participants found to have LS.\nFirst-degree relatives (parents, siblings and adult children \u2265 25 years of age) of the CRC participants who do not have LS.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nPrisoners.\nIndividuals who are under the age of 18.\nIndividuals must have a primary colorectal or endometrial cancer, not a recurrence of a previous colorectal or endometrial cancer.",
