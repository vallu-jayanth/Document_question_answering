                "DetailedDescription": "This retrospective descriptive study will review charts of approximately 375 cancer patients prescribed rivaroxaban from January 1, 2012 to November 7, 2016 at UT MDACC for NVAF or patients that had prior VTE and diagnosis of cancer. The list of patients prescribed rivaroxaban during the study period will be obtained from Pharmacy Informatics. We will review the eligibility of all patients on the pharmacy list who were prescribed rivaroxaban during the study time-frame. The eligible patients who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be identified. All available data concerning demographic, clinical parameters and rivaroxaban usage will be collected for eligible patients from Pharmacy Informatics, CS, Laboratory Informatics, and Clinical Informatics Databases.\n\nThe variables of interest include demographic information, clinical parameters (tumor type, extent of disease, clinical exam findings, and presence of comorbidities, diagnostic assessments, and treatment interventions), reason for rivaroxaban discontinuation and outcomes. The confidentiality of all patient-specific data will be maintained. By using Pharmacy Informatics and CS, we can capture most of patients prescribed rivaroxaban at the UT MDACC.This is a descriptive study and the final sample size will depend on available records for chart review from 01/01/2012 to 11/07/2016."
