In TOWARDS-II, the investigators will develop patient derived models (PDMs), comprising patient derived xenografts (PDXs) and organoids (PDO and PDxO), from patients newly diagnosed with local or locally advanced hormone receptor-low/Her2 negative or triple negative breast cancer. The investigators will prospectively evaluate the correlation between PDX engraftment with recurrence. Using PDMs, the investigators will perform genomic studies and functional drug screens (FPO). Upon disease recurrence, the investigators will return the results to the physician with the intent to inform treatment selection."

HER2 expression 3+ on IHC or amplified (defined as HER2/CEP17 ratio \u22652 or copy number >6) on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). If HER2 expression is 2+ on IHC, reflex FISH must be performed to determine eligibility.\nPatient has bilateral breast cancer\n\nPatient received any anti-cancer therapy or any investigational therapy prior to study entry and collection of tumor.\n\n--Treatment includes: neoadjuvant therapy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, bisphosphonates for an indication other than osteopenia/osteoporosis, and/or hormonal therapy administered for the currently diagnosed primary breast cancer prior to study entry. Hormonal therapy for a prior diagnosis of a hormone receptor-positive breast cancer us allowed.\n\nThe diagnosis of another malignancy, unless the patient is considered disease-free for \u22655 years before study entry. Patients are eligible if diagnosed and treated for carcinoma in situ of the cervix, melanoma in situ, colon cancer in situ, ductal carcinoma in situ, and basal and/or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, early stage papillary thyroid cancer, and other low risk malignancies per investigator discretion.\nPrior history of local or locally advanced hormone receptor positive (ER and/or PR expression >10% on immunohistochemistry) and Her2 positive or negative breast cancer is allowed so long as patients have completed all treatments with curative intent (except adjuvant medical non-chemotherapy treatments, e.g. adjuvant endocrine therapy with any hormonal agent) AND an interval of 6 months has elapsed between completion of these treatments and histologic diagnosis of eligible breast cancer AND all other eligibility criteria are otherwise met.\n\nThe subject has uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including, but not limited to, the following conditions:\n\nMyocardial infarction (<6 months prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (> New York Heart Association Classification Class IIB) or a serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication.\nRenal or liver disease that prohibits the patient from receiving at least single-agent full recommended dose chemotherapy.\n\nCurrent evidence of uncontrolled, significant intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, the following conditions:\n\nCardiovascular disorders:\n\nCongestive heart failure New York Heart Association Class III or IV, unstable angina pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmias.\nStroke (including transient ischemic attack [TIA]), myocardial infarction (MI), or other ischemic events, or thromboembolic event (eg, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) within 3 months before the first dose.\nQTc prolongation defined as a QTcF > 500 ms.\nKnown congenital long QT.\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction < 55%.\nUncontrolled hypertension defined as \u2265 160/100 as assessed from the mean of three consecutive blood pressure measurements taken over 10 minutes.\nAny other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate the subject's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance with clinical study procedures (e.g., infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction, unable to swallow medication, [subjects may not receive the drug through a feeding tube], social/ psychological issues, etc.)\nMedical, psychiatric, cognitive, or other conditions that may compromise the subject's ability to understand the subject information, give informed consent, comply with the study protocol or complete the study.",
