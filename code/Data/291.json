                "BriefSummary": "Bluestar Genomics has developed a non-invasive test that aids in the qualitative detection of occult pancreatic cancer in patients with new onset type II diabetes (NOD) who are 50 years old or older. The purpose of this study is to validate the performance of Bluestar Genomics early-detection pancreatic cancer test. The study is prospective, longitudinal and interventional; tests will be ordered and results returned to site-investigators. If the assay returns a pancreatic cancer signal \"detected\" result, the study participant will undergo MRI imaging to evaluate for the presence of pancreatic cancer. The study is planned to enroll 10,000 newly diagnosed type II diabetic subjects according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.",
                "DetailedDescription": "This is a prospective longitudinal and interventional study of the Bluestar Genomics early detection pancreatic cancer test. The test will be ordered and results returned to site-investigators. The study is planned to enroll 10,000 male and female, \u2265 50 years of age and newly diagnosed with type II diabetes (within 90 days prior to enrollment). The study population will target 70% of subjects over 65 years old, 53% males and will target to enroll at least 50% of subjects with a BMI <32.\n\nEach subject can undergo to up to 3 blood draws; at the time of enrollment (T0), at 6 months (T1) and 12 months (T2) from diabetes diagnosis. If test result is \"detected\", MRI imaging will be performed to further assess the pancreas. If the MRI imaging study results are abnormal, the subject will be referred back to their enrolling clinician for additional diagnostic work up as part of routine healthcare. After 24 months from diabetes diagnosis, a review of the electronic medical records (EMR) will be performed for all subjects with a \"not detected\" test result.\n\nThe study will also include an Bluestar Genomics's test \"not detected\" imaging arm (negative control imaging arm) for each time point. Subjects included in the negative imaging arm will be pre-specified and randomly selected among the Bluestar Genomics \"not detected\" cases gender ratio and age matched to Bluestar Genomics \"detected\" and will undergo MRI imaging."
