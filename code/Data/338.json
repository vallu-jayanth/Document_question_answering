                "DetailedDescription": "This is a translational study. Patient will undergo standard treatment and tissue and blood samples will be taken at various time points:\n\nTissue: Fresh frozen (FF) and Formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (FFPE) will be collected at time of surgery/biopsy of a primary or a recurrent/metastatic tumour tissue.\n\nBlood: Two types of study bloods (non-heparinised and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)) will be taken pre-neoadjuvant treatment (if applicable), pre- and post-operatively of primary and recurrent/ metastatic breast cancer (if recurrent/metastatic diagnosis and no biopsy/surgery required then study bloods will be taken prior to starting treatment).\n\nAdditional blood samples will be taken annually at follow-up visits for 5 years from primary cases and for up to 2 years from recurrent/metastatic cases.\n\nNon-heparinised blood will be processed to serum. Clinical data will be collected at all times of biological sampling."
