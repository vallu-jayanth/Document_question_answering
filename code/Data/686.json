                "BriefSummary": "CovidSurg-Cancer is an international, multicentre, observational cohort study designed to evaluate the 30-day COVID-19 infection rates in elective cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCentres can elect to include one or more cancer types in the study, in any combination, depending on local expertise and capacity. During the pilot study, investigators should enrol patients with confirmed diagnoses of:\n\nColorectal cancer\nOesophagogastric cancer\n\nAs a rapid response study to the COVID-19 pandemic, included cancer types will evolve throughout the course of the CovidSurg-Cancer study period, for example, to include breast, liver, pancreatic, gynaecological, urological cancers, or sarcomas.",
                "DetailedDescription": "The rapid emergence of the COVID-19 virus has led to a global impact on elective surgical care.\n\nWe have very little evidence to guide us. The magnitude and effects of these changes are uncertain. The safety of operating on patients electively with the risks of COVID-19 postoperative pneumonia is unknown.\n\nHigh-quality data will allow policy planning at regional and hospital level for both this outbreak and future pandemics. CovidSurg-Cancer will run in parallel to CovidSurg (which is capturing outcomes of patients undergoing surgery for all indications with concurrent COVID-19).\n\nThe primary aim is to evaluate the 30-day COVID-19 infection rates in elective cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSecondary aims include; comparison of the 30-day postoperative mortality rate in cancer surgery patients that develop COVID-19 infection versus those who do not; an exploration of the scale of resource constraints related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and their impact on outcomes of elective cancer surgery; to explore variation in the selection of patients for continuing elective cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic; to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on treatment pathways for cancers with a decision for surgical resection with curative intent.\n\nThis investigator-led, non-commercial, non-interventional study is extremely low to zero risk. This study does not collect any patient identifiable information and data will not be analysed at hospital-level."
