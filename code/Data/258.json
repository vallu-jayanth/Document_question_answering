The study will survey information about the patient at time of diagnosis, clinical staging, details of initial treatment, status of disease progression, and prognosis at the end point of the study. The purpose of the study is to clarify distribution of staging, the actual status of treatment choices and treatment outcomes.",
                "DetailedDescription": "The A-CaP will collect information in a linkable anonymized format from all medical institutions in Asian countries participating in the study and will engage in data analysis. J-CaP which has previous experience of engaging in a similar study in 2010 wll be a sponsor for A-CaP study, the aggregated results of which have been reported. The registration period for this study will be three years followed by 7 years of follow-up study, and research will be implemented across a wider range of Asian countries, with new institutions participating for the purposes of this study. As this study will be an observational study the acquisition of data will be relatively simple, and as the content of the study will be almost identical to the study conducted by J-CaP in 2010, a system for research implementation is already established at J-CaP."
