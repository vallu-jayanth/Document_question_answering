                "BriefSummary": "A prospective multicenter randomized non-inferiority clinical trial, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 1.0 cm-safety margin surgery, compared with 1.5 cm safety margin surgery for cT1-2N0 oral tongue cancer\n\nSummary:\n\nA current standard primary treatment for oral tongue cancer is a curative surgical resection with/without adjuvant radiation treatments (or chemoradiation).\n\nIn pathological analysis of surgical specimens, more than 5 mm of non-tumorous tissues from the tumor border is regarded as a safe negative resection margin, according to the NCCN guideline (the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, Dec 10. 2020). To achieve this clear margin, surgeons are apt to use a 1.0 to 1.5 cm safety margin around the gross tumor during surgery, considering 30-50% tumor shrinkage in tissue fixation process.\n\nMany previous retrospective data have been reported to suggest the optimal or proper surgical extent for oral tongue cancer. Wider resection can lead to better local control, however, it sacrifices more normal tissue, resulting in the functional deficit of tongue (speech and swallowing), even with reconstruction.\n\nUnfortunately up to now, no prospective comparison of a different surgical safety margin for oral tongue cancer have been conducted to draw a more solid conclusion. Particularly in early stage oral tongue cancer (cT1-2N0), some study results have suggested that less than 5 mm resection margin in pathology specimens can be also safe and effective in terms of tumor control.\n\nTo achieve a well-grounded result about the proper surgical safety margin in early stage (cT1-2N0) oral tongue cancer, we will compare the outcomes of the two (1.5 cm versus 1.0 cm) surgical safety margin in curative resection for cT1-2N0 oral tongue cancer.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Randomization\n\nThe randomized allocation table was made by stratified block randomization methods with 1:1 ratio according to each participating surgeon and tumor stage.\nBaseline number (BN) should be provided to the subjects in the order of the date of surgery.\n\nSurgical Procedure\n\nThe study includes T1-2N0 oral tongue cancer patients. For the management of the primary lesion, wide resection with 1.0- or 1.5-cm surgical safety margin should be performed according to the results of study allocation.\nNeck management can be resection of primary tumor without neck dissection, with ipsilateral or bilateral neck dissection (guided by tumor location) or with sentinel lymph node biopsy, according to the NCCN guideline (version 1.2021).\n\nEvaluation of the surgical safety margin\n\nThe surgical safety margin should be meticulously evaluated in the pathology specimens in all directions.\nThe surgical margins less than 0.3 or 0.5 cm in final pathology results are considered as the close surgical margin.\n\nAdjuvant Treatment\n\nThe adjuvant treatments either radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy are conducted if indicated following the NCCN guideline.\nThe follow-up after completion of the definitive treatment are made following the NCCN guideline.\n\nEfficacy evaluation\n\nThe primary outcomes are determined with 2-year local control rates after the completion of the curative treatments.\nThe secondary outcomes are determined with the 5-year disease-free survival rates and speech/articulation functional analysis."
