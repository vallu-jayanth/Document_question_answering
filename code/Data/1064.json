Tumour samples will be made available following patient enrollment for the primary debulking group, and following surgery for the neoadjuvant group for mutation analysis. Ascites will not be accepted. Up to four blood samples in the primary debulking group and up to five blood samples in the neoadjuvant group will be collected from each patient over a 6-8 month period for ctDNA and Ca125 analysis Choice of chemotherapy will be platinum based treatment at the treating clinician's discretion as per standard of care."

In cases with germline BRCA mutations, where normal or non-tumour cells also harbour the specific DNA changes, we would expect to find the fraction of mutant DNA for a given gene to be much higher. If unexpected results are found for mutations, indicating the possibility of an inherited mutation, the patient will be informed of the result by their treating doctor and the potential implication."
