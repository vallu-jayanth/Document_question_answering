                "BriefSummary": "Background:\n\nPatients treated for rectal cancer are in high risk of developing poor quality of life and faecal incontinence. Faecal incontinence has a negative impact on quality of life. However, there is limited knowledge on how to prevent it. Known exposures are ; age at surgery, gender, tumor height, pre-operative radiotherapy, surgical technique and temporary stoma. In order to evaluate the underlying mechanisms of faecal incontinence, it is central to evaluate the anorectal muscle function for sensory and motor impairment. Exposures representing different constructs in the biopsychosocial model are likewise likely to be associated with quality of life and faecal incontinence. These exposures include sexual dysfunction, urinary incontinence, fatique, physical inactivity and finding meaning in life. There are to our knowledge, no records on these relationships from prior to surgery to 2 years after. These biopsychosocial exposures are central to include when developing strategies that can prevent poor quality of life and faecal incontinence for patients treated for rectal cancer.\n\nPurpose:\n\nThe primary purpose of the EDFI-Cohort study is to determine how several variables (surgical technique, anorectal muscle function, faecal incontinence, urinary incontinence, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, physical activity and finding meaning in life) develop over time and predicts quality of life. Secondary how it predicts LARS-score in patients with rectal cancer from prior to surgery to 2 years after primary treatment.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe will include subjects diagnosed with rectal cancer and have received curative surgery (low anterior resection) with/without adjuvant (radiation/chemo) therapy. The cohort aim to recruit all eligible patients in a one year period. We estimate to recruit 70 patients.\n\nSelf-reported outcomes will be collected with a series of validated questionnaires that subjects will be asked to complete 6 times during the two year study at 3, 6, 12, 26 78 and 104 weeks. Outcomes include: Quality of life using (EORTC QLQ-C30) (primary outcome), (CR29) and (FA12), bowel related quality of life (LARS-score) (secondary outcome), faecal incontinence (Vaizey score), urinary incontinence (ICIQ-UI), (MLUTS/FLUTS) and (MLUTSsex/FLUTSsex), physical activity level from Danish National Health Profile and finding meaning in life (SOME).\n\nObjective measures will be collected at 6 weeks, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months and include: Anorectal manometry that measures anorectal muscle function and rectal perception, a digital examination of anorectal muscle function using the Digital Rectal Examination Scoring System (DRESS) and the six-minute walk test a measure of submaximal exercise capacity.\n\nWe plan to analyze the EDFI-Cohort study as repeated measures with both simple and multiple linear regression models for the continuous data. We plan to adjust for known confounders and variables related to treatment."
