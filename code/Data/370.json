Each 60-minute session will include cardiovascular, strength, and flexibility training. The intensity level for the aerobic exercise ranges from 30-45% of the individual's predicted VO2max, controlled by heart monitors and lasting 30 min. Strength training will involve a full body workout, with emphasis on all major muscle groups and employing machines, free weights, and resistance tubing. Patients will complete 3 sets of 10 repetitions for each strength exercise. Flexibility training will involve static stretching of all major muscle groups for 15-20 seconds at the completion of each workout.",

Five domains (physical well-being, physical symptoms, psychological, existential, and support) were identified through principal component analysis, and each of the domains is scored as a separate sub-scale. An overall index score can be calculated from the means of the five sub-scales. The single-item global quality of life scale is included as a validity variable but also can be used in conjunction with the overall MQOL and sub-scale scores.Each question uses a 0-10 scale with anchors at each end.",
