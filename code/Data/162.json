According to the statistical hypothesis based on expected detection performance, the study will enroll approximately 3,830 participants, including 2,138 participants with cancer (case arm) and approximately 1,692 representative participants without a clinical diagnosis of cancer after medical screening (control arm). Participants pre-matched by age and gender will be divided into training set and validation set in a ratio of approximately 7:3. The validation set will be blinded until the models are developed. Clinical information, demographics, and medical data relevant to cancer status are collected from all participants and their medical records at baseline. The participants of control arm will be asked to report suspected cancer diagnosis status within 6 months after blood collection."
