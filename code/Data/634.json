                "BriefSummary": "Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed and third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States for both men and women. The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates about 108,070 new cases of colon cancer and 40,740 new cases of rectal cancer will be diagnosed, and about 49,960 deaths will occur as a result of this devastating disease in 2008. Over the last 20 years, the death rate for this cancer has been dropping as a result of screening and early detection of cancer. In 2007, ACS reported that early-stage colorectal cancer had a survival rate close to 80%, and up to 9,632 deaths could be prevented each year if eligible patients received screening when necessary. However, despite the proven efficacy of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, only about 50% of eligible US patients are currently being screened.\n\nSpecific Aims\n\nThe central hypothesis of this proposal is that patient-initiated prompting of primary care physicians of the patient's interest in screening will increase referrals for CRC screening. The following three areas will be investigated during this research:\n\nTo determine whether a communication tool provided to patients will initiate a conversation with their primary care physicians about CRC screening, especially via colonoscopy.\nTo determine whether this tool will impact referral patterns for screening, especially, although not primarily, among poor and underserved populations.\nTo determine whether differences exist in regard to patient-physician communication patterns about screening among residents and faculties in the fields of internal medicine and family practice clinics.\n\nAt the close of the investigators study, the investigators wish to organize quantifiable data demonstrating how patient-initiated prompting of primary care physicians for CRC screening increases early detection and decreases potential mortality from colorectal cancer. This data will inform a second, larger study to pursue the questions surrounding patient-initiated prompting in"
