                "BriefSummary": "Primary Objective:\n\nTo determine the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the Biomoda CyPath\u2122 Early Lung Cancer Detection Assay using sputum specimens from two cohorts of participants and estimate the required sample size to finalize a protocol for a pivotal study.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nTo assess the capability of the Biomoda CyPath\u2122 Early Lung Cancer Detection Assay in a clinical setting to identify cancer cells, as assessed by TCPP labeled cancer cells demonstrating red fluorescence under a microscope with ultraviolet (UV) light being observed with a FITC (Fluorescein isothiocyanate) Filter.\nTo assess the capability of the Biomoda CyPath\u2122 Early Lung Cancer Detection Assay to detect pre-invasive cancer in comparison with PAP sputum cytology and routine CT scan.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Meso Tetra (4-Carboxyphenyl) Porphine (TCPP) is a porphyrin that can label cancer cells by reacting to the increased number of low-density lipoproteins coating the surface of cancer cells and the porous nature of the cancer cell membrane, causing the cell to fluoresce under specific wavelengths of light. The primary objective of this clinical trial was to determine the clinical sensitivity and specificity of the CyPath\u00ae Lung Cancer Detection Assay (\"CyPath\u00ae Assay\") using sputum specimens from two cohorts of Participants. The Study design included a protocol to assess the capability of the Biomoda CyPath\u00ae Lung Cancer Detection Assay to detect cancer in comparison with routine high-resolution, low-dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) scans.\n\nOptimization of the Assay can lead to improved sensitivity and specificity. Increase in sample size and evaluation of the entire sputum sample can increase data collection and differentiation between cohorts. Technicians in the current Study examined 12 slides containing approximately 600,000 cells. The average sputum sample pellet translates to a potential of approximately 3.5 million cells for evaluation. Evaluating the full sputum sample with the CyPath\u00ae Assay can be accomplished through flow cytometry and would increase the capture and analysis of exfoliated cancer cells in the sample. In-house studies evaluated samples from five different cancer cell lines using flow cytometry. Preliminary results showed that cancer cell lines were detected with significant fluorescence apart from normal cell fluorescence. Refinements for using the flow cytometer include optimizing the liquid-based assay and sample analysis and focus on concentration, incubation time and optimal sample volume."

Specificity was the percentage of true positive signals and accuracy calculated as the percentage of those patients identified as having cancer.\n\nTesting for the study was performed at multiple locations to assess the efficacy of the CyPath Assay to detect lung cancer cells exfoliated from lung tumors present in deep-lung sputum. Participants who satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study and assigned to one of two cohorts (smoker with clear Low dose CT scan or \"high-risk\" normals,\" and lung cancer confirmed by pathology or \"cancer\").",
