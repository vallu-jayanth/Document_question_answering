                "BriefSummary": "This research study will collect blood and tumor tissue samples from patients with soft tissue sarcoma to look at circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). When tumor cells are damaged or die, DNA from the tumor cells are released into the blood stream as the cells break down. This is called circulating tumor DNA. Circulating tumor DNA is an important biomarker that may be used in cancer detection, prediction of treatment response, and disease monitoring.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Researchers are continually looking for ways to understand the biology of cancer such as sarcoma, and ways to improve cancer care and patient outcome.\n\nResearch has shown that changes in some genes and/or proteins, called biomarkers, may be important indicators for certain cancers and response to treatments. Genes are molecules made up of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). DNA contain instructions for the development and functioning of the cells in the body and are passed down from parent to child. RNA is involved with producing proteins in the body. Further research is needed to better understand the changes found in cancer cells and what this means for certain treatments.\n\nCirculating tumor DNA is an important biomarker that may be used in cancer detection, prediction of treatment response and disease monitoring. When tumor cells are damaged or die, DNA from the tumor cells are released into the blood stream as the cells break down. This is called circulating tumor DNA. Researchers are looking for better ways to detect circulating tumor DNA so that it can be studied.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine how feasible it is to detect circulating tumor DNA in blood samples of soft tissue sarcoma patients and whether there is a connection between circulating tumor DNA and the likelihood of patients' disease coming back after they receive treatment. To do this, blood and tumor tissue samples will be collected from participants and will undergo DNA testing (reading the contents of their DNA, called sequencing). The results of the DNA testing in the blood samples will be compared with the results from DNA testing that will also be done on tumor tissue. The results will also be compared with participant's response to their treatment, recurrence, and/or long term survival."
