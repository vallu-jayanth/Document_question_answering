                "DetailedDescription": "Cervical cancer is a cancer arising from the cervix. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection causes more than 90% of cases. Other risk factors include smoking, a weak immune system, birth control pills, starting sex at a young age, and having many sexual partners, but these are less important. Worldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common cause of cancer and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. The treatment of cervical cancer consists of surgical intervention, radiation, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.\n\nIn this study, the participant's T-cells will be collected and modified. Then the modified T cells, called chimeric antigen receptor modified-T cells (CAR T) which can recognize specific molecules that are expressed on the surface of cervical cancer cells, are given back to the participant by intravenous infusion.\n\nThe purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of CAR T cells immunotherapy in patients who have GD2, PSMA, Muc1, Mesothelin or other markers positive cervical cancer. Another goal of the study is to learn more about the persistence and function of CAR T cells in the body."
