                "BriefSummary": "The goal of this clinical research study is to compare the use of an ultrasound-guided biopsy with what is found during surgery in finding evidence of the disease.",
                "DetailedDescription": "If you agree to take part in this study, you will have an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the tumor site. To perform this biopsy, a needle is inserted into the affected area using an ultrasound to collect cells or tissue from a tumor mass. The doctor will use the ultrasound to guide the needle into the area. Two (2) types of samples will be collected: a fine needle aspirate (FNA) that collects cells and a core biopsy that collects a small piece of tissue. If the tumor is not seen well by the ultrasound, the study doctor may use a mammogram to perform the biopsy.\n\nYou will then have the same planned surgery and post-operative care that you would normally have. You will sign a separate consent for your surgery.\n\nYour medical records may be reviewed and information recorded from your routine follow-up visits in order to follow your general health and the outcome of your surgery.\n\nLength of Study Participation:\n\nYour active participation in this study will be finished when you have had your surgery and completed your post-operative care.\n\nThis is an investigational study. It is investigational to compare the use of an ultrasound-guided biopsy with what is found during surgery in finding evidence of the disease.\n\nUp to 40 participants will take part on this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
