Previous research as well as literature studies support the close relationship between ex vivo drug sensitivity and in vivo drug response.",
                "DetailedDescription": "The patient underwent surgery to remove tumor and agreed to take out the abdominal tumor specimens for research. A section of each sample was removed for the generation of PDX models as described early.The rest of the tumor cells were expanded using ex vivo drug sensitivity assay.\n\nThe drugs used in the study were 5-fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin, and irinotecan at C0 = 10 mM, 2.5 mM and 0.02 mM, respectively. They were applied either as single agents or in combinations of 5-fluorouracil and Oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan, or all three agents, or others. After 7 days of treatment, the tumor cells were stained with EdU, Hoechst and EpCAM with the Cell Quantitative Detection Kit. Images were acquired with an automated microscopic image-scanning system and analyzed with the built-in software."
