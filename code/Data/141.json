The number, cancer types, and cancer clinical stage of cancer patients diagnosed via the OverC multi-cancer detection blood test will be recorded.\n\nThe study will enroll approximately 12,500 participants as defined by eligibility criteria with an anticipated enrollment period of approximately 9 months at up to 30 clinical sites within China. Participants will be actively followed for approximately 5 years from the date of their enrollment."
