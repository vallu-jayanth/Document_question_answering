Telemedicine is the use of secure video technology on a desktop computer, laptop, smartphone, or tablet to provide and receive healthcare from a distance. The telemedicine program used in this study is called a tele-geriatric oncology program. It involves the participant and a study nurse meeting by videoconferencing during 2-6 telemedicine visits. As part of the program, the participant and the study nurse will discuss the participant's symptoms and aging-related needs."
