To establish a large biospecimen repository that is linked to clinical and related data.\n\nIII. To follow patients through their lifetime though passive or active follow-up.\n\nIV. To use clinical data, tissues, other biological samples and derived molecular data in the Total Cancer Care Protocol (TCCP) repositories to match patients in this TCCP study to future studies.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients undergo collection of blood during a regular care visit or not up to 4 times a year. Extra tissue is collected after removal during standard of care surgery and patients may undergo additional tumor sampling (needle passes) at the time of planned diagnostic biopsies. During bone marrow biopsy, the doctor may reposition the needle up to 3 times, and bone marrow for research will not be collected more than 4 times per year. Patients may undergo additional collection of other biological samples such as saliva, sputum, urine, feces, hair, and surface skin swabs for analysis. Patients also receive surveys or questionnaires to collect demographics, medical, family, and nutritional history, cancer predisposing risk factors, quality of life data, and quality of care data.\n\nAfter completion of study, patients are followed up periodically."
