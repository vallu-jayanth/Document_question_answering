This will provide preliminary efficacy data in prevision of a larger, confirmatory, randomized controlled trial. As this study will be one of the first led in a French speaking country and the first conducted in a university hospital environment in Switzerland, the investigators would like to investigate the early implementation of this program among professionals and patients. Furthermore, they will investigate if in the online MBCR group, participants will show improvement in psychosocial outcomes, consumption of psychotropic and opioid medication, spirituality and meaning in life and in different biological processes."

As the weeks progress, different forms of meditation are introduced, beginning with a body scan sensory awareness experience, progressing to sitting and walking meditations. Gentle Hatha yoga is incorporated throughout, as a form of moving meditation. Didactic instruction as well as group discussion and reflection, problem solving and skillful inquiry are commonly applied teaching tools.",

It comprises two subscales, one reflects a sense of meaning and peace and the other assessing the role of faith in illness. It is predictive of quality of life in breast cancer survivors, adjustment to cancer and decline of depressive symptoms and reduced long-term care. 7 of the 12 items specifically investigate a current spiritual state.
