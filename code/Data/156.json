Each session will last 60-90 minutes and be delivered by a trained therapist. After each session, participants will be given home-based exercises to practice the skills learned in the sessions. With the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, instead of face-to-face sessions only, a hybrid mode of intervention delivery will be used by offering participants the choice of face-to-face or online sessions.",
