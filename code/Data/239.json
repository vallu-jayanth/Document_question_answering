                "BriefSummary": "This study aims to develop a smartphone-based psychosocial intervention for patients with colorectal cancer and their family caregivers and to improve patients' confidence in self-care, psychological well-being, social support, quality of life, and satisfaction with care, as well as caregivers' burden, psychological well-being, and quality of life. The study also aims to explore patients' and their caregivers' perceptions of the intervention and routine care. A multi-centre two-arm experimental study design is used in this study. A total of 100 patient-caregiver dyads will be recruited and randomly allocated to either the control group (receiving routine care alone) or the intervention group (receiving routine care plus the psychosocial intervention). After completed the study, 15 patient-caregiver dyads will be invited for interviews to explore their perceptions on the intervention and/or routine care. This study will generate evidence on the effectiveness of the easily accessible and sustainable smartphone-based psychosocial intervention.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Aims The aims of the study are: (1) To develop an interactive Colorectal Cancer self-Management enhancement smartphone-based psychosocial intervention programme (iCanManage program); (2) To examine the effectiveness of iCanManage for colorectal cancer patients and their caregivers in improving patients' health outcomes including self-efficacy (primary outcome), psychological well-being (anxiety & depression), social support, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and satisfaction with care, as well as caregivers' burden, psychological well-being, and quality of life (QoL) (primary outcome); and (3) To explore patients' and their caregivers' perceptions of iCanManage and routine care.\nHypotheses Over 3 months' follow-up, compared to patients in the control group,patients who receive iCanManage in addition to hospital routine care will report significantly: (1) higher levels of self-efficacy, social support, HRQoL and satisfaction with care, and (2) lower levels of anxiety and depression; whilst caregivers will report significantly lower levels of burden, anxiety and depression, and higher level of QoL.\nMethodology A multi-centre two-arm randomised controlled trial will be conducted at two public hospitals in Singapore. A total of 100 patient-caregiver dyads will be recruited via convenience sampling. Participants (patient-caregiver dyads) will be randomly allocated to either the intervention (receiving iCanManage in addition to hospital routine care) or the control group (receiving only hospital routine care). The aforementioned outcomes of both patients and caregivers will be measured at baseline (start of access to iCanManage), 2-weeks post-surgery (end of access to iCanManage) and 3-months post-surgery. Descriptive statistics, repeated measures analysis of covariance, univariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to analyse the data. At the end of the trial, semi-structured interviews will be conducted to explore 30 patients' and 30 caregivers' perceptions on iCanManage and or routine care. The transcribed interview data will be analysed using a thematic analysis.\nSignificance of the study This study will generate evidence on the effectiveness of the easily accessible and sustainable iCanManage. Should the quantitative and qualitative findings support the feasibility and effects of the intervention, it can be adopted by hospital policymakers as added routine care to enhance patients' self-management ability throughout their surgery journey."
