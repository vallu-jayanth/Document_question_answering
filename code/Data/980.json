When cancer does develop antigen-specific immune (T) cells are still present in the blood but are either not responding or are not effective. Vaccines stimulate these T cells to respond and kill cancer cells.\n\nACIT-1 is designed to stimulate tumour antigen-specific T cells to respond and kill cancer cells."
