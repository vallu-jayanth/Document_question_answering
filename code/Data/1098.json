MIND programme for cancer thus comprises 8 weekly group sessions, lasting 1 and a half hour each, run in small groups at an Oncology Service at the Coimbra's University Hospital. For each week participants have assigned homework (e.g., mindfulness exercises). This programme mainly aims to increase participants' physical and psychosocial quality of life, and attenuate depressed mood and anxiety.",
                "DetailedDescription": "The sample will include diagnosed cancer patients recruited at an Oncology Service at the Coimbra's University Hospital. Patients will be approached by their doctor to assess their level of interest in the investigation. Patients who demonstrate interest will go through a Screening interview conducted by a licensed psychologist that aims explain the structure and arms of the investigation, to collect demographic data, and whether the patient meets the inclusion criteria for the study. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and demonstrate interest in participating in the study, will sign an informed consent. All ethical requirements for research with humans are guaranteed.\n\nAfterwards, participants will be allocated in two groups (experimental and control group). Both groups will maintain the medical treatment as usual (TAU). Additionally, the experimental group will enroll in the MIND programme for cancer patients, also provided by a licensed psychologist.\n\nBoth groups will concurrently complete a protocol of self-report measures and their medical data will be collected by the medical staff of the Hospital."
