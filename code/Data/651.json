                "DetailedDescription": "The Dartmouth Cancer Center's Community Outreach and Engagement Team will implement Screen to Save 2 in two formats-traditional outreach using in-person fairs and an online format. The education in both formats will be based on a set of key messages that cover information about colorectal cancer, including risk factors, prevention, screening recommendations, and screening options. Key messages provided by the National Cancer Institute will be tailored to the local context of NH and VT, including information about local options for getting screened for colorectal cancer. A third arm will receive education about lung cancer screening. This third arm will serve as the control arm for the first two arms (the arms receiving in-person or online colorectal cancer screening education) to assess study Aim 1. This third arm will also serve as an intervention arm for assessing Study Aim 2.\n\nUsing online or telephone surveys, some participants will be contacted approximately three months after their initial participation. Some of the participants contacted after three months will again be contacted another three months later (six months after initial participation). The three- and six-month surveys will assess knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors related to cancer screening, including outcomes from cancer screening.\n\nThe primary aims of the study are as follows:\n\nAim 1: Implement and evaluate Screen to Save 2 outreach and educational activities to improve knowledge of colorectal cancer screening methods, to increase intent to get screened for colorectal cancer, and connect screening services to the target population.\n\nAim 1a: Conduct cancer screening fairs in Rural Urban Continuum Code (RUCC) 7-9 counties, using the Screen to Save 2 framework and materials and, where feasible, coordinate with local service providers to make colorectal cancer screening services available to event attendees.\n\nAim 1b: Utilize web-based module to conduct targeted outreach about colorectal cancer screening using the Screen to Save 2 framework and materials and refer them to locally-available screenings, healthcare provider systems, and/or healthcare coverage systems.\n\nThe secondary aim of the study is:\n\nAim 2: Evaluate online educational activities' ability to reach 45-74 year old current and former tobacco users from rural (RUCC 7-9) counties, increase lung cancer screening knowledge among that demographic, and encourage engagement with local tobacco treatment resources and lung cancer screening."
