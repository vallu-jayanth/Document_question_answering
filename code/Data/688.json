                "BriefSummary": "The objectives of this study are to: 1) describe the prevalence of neuropathic pain (NP) in breast cancer survivors and 2) to develop preliminary statistical risk models for predicting the risk for NP incorporating disease-related variables (e.g., stage of disease, location of tumor), treatment variables (chemotherapy, dose, duration; and other cancer therapy), clinical health status (e.g., comorbid conditions), and sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, race).\n\nResearchers will also gather data to answer the following secondary aims:\n\nTo assess the impact of NP on quality of life.\nTo assess the current management of NP in cancer (current medication, duration of such treatment, reasons for discontinuation) and the outcomes of this management.",
                "DetailedDescription": "You have already been contacted by phone about participating in this study. You have received study documents (this consent and the study questionnaires) because you said over the phone that you would like to participate in this study.\n\nIn this study you will be asked to complete questionnaires that will ask about any pain you may be experiencing and about the quality of your life. These questionnaires will also ask for demographic information (such as age, race, and sex) and about your health. It should take about 1 hour to complete all of the questionnaires. In addition to the questionnaires, you will also be asked questions about any medications you may currently be taking for pain. All of the information you include on the questionnaires will be kept confidential. There are no right or wrong answers to the questions. A postage-paid return envelope has been provided for you to return this consent and the questionnaires.\n\nResearchers are interested in how pain is related to certain treatments and medical conditions. As part of this study, researchers will review your medical records to see what type of cancer treatment you received and whether you had any pain related to the treatment. They will also see if you had any non-cancer health conditions that may have affected pain and quality of life.\n\nThis survey is for research purposes only. Your healthcare provider will not be informed of your responses to this survey. If you are experiencing severe pain and/or other symptoms, please contact your healthcare provider. The study staff has also included a list of community resources that you may contact for different types of services.\n\nYour participation in this study will be over once you mail back the consent and questionnaires.\n\nThis is an investigational study. Up to 635 individuals will be asked to take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson."

The S-LANSS is a 7-item instrument that identifies pain of predominantly neuropathic origin. A score of 10 or more (out of a maximum of 24), regarded as a \"positive\" score, identifies neuropathic pain with a sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value all of 80%. It has been found to be valid and reliable in both clinical and mail-survey settings [Bennett et al 2004]. The IDP is a 6-item scale that assesses the quality of pain, and has been well-validated [Portenoy, et al, 2006].",
