                "BriefSummary": "Psychological interventions for cancer patients have been tested and found to reduce stress and improve quality of life. These interventions have been tested at academic medical centers but have not been available for use by community mental health professionals. One such intervention is the Biobehavioral Intervention (BBI), developed by Professor Barbara L. Andersen and colleagues at Ohio State (OSU). Current funding has enabled the investigators to train mental health professionals from across the country to deliver the BBI at their institution. Recently diagnosed cancer patients who are participating in the BBI group at these institutions may participate in a research study completing self report measures asking about psychological and behavioral outcomes (for example, mood, stress, diet and physical activity). The investigators hypothesize that individuals participating in the intervention will report improvements in outcomes, such as reduced stress and improved mood, reduced symptoms of the disease and treatment, etc., after completing the intervention and continue to report these improvements up to 6 months after the group ends. OSU will coordinate this data collection project but information about participating sites is listed in http://clinicaltrials.gov."
