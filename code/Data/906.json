The aim of this study is to identify clinical actionable targets and predict in vivo response of the tumor to targeted drugs by using PDOs/ PDXs. And the above-mentioned studies will provide the patients with potential personalized cancer treatment options.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Patient-derived organoid is a model that can recapitulate the histology and behavior of the cancer from which it is derived, and is increasingly used as a tool for drug development in pre-clinical settings. Clinical treatment option of colorectal cancer now is quite limited. By molecular profiling, clinical actionable alterations may be identified. And according to the genomic investigation results, we can find the matched targeted drugs, following further testing in the organoids and PDXs. This will provide an opportunity to guide the precision medicine."
