Based largely on \"PTSD Coach\" from the National Center for PTSD, the CDC app was redesigned for both iOS and Android platforms and is tailored specifically to individuals impacted by cancer.\n\nThis study aims to evaluate whether CDC app usage influences symptoms of PTSD through a randomized controlled trial (RCT) where subjects are placed into either the intervention group or the wait-listed control group for a period of 8 weeks. The CDC app is available as a free download on the App Store\u00ae and on Google Play\u2122."

The main action of the application is in the Activities module that provides patients with skills to manage their stress in the moment they experience it. Depending on the severity, the patient is routed to any of a number of helpful skills based on cognitive-behavioral principles. The stress management tools include positive imageries, soothing songs and pictures, and the Relax-Identify-Decide tool. Also included is \"find support\" and \"get support now\" to connect the user to his/her support network and locate informal cancer and non-cancer related support or (immediate) professional care.",
