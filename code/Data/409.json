                "BriefSummary": "This research study is studying a drug called GDC-0084 as a possible treatment for HER2-Positive Breast Cancer.\n\nThe drugs involved in this study are:\n\nGDC-0084\nTrastuzumab (Herceptin\u00ae)",
                "DetailedDescription": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a specific disease. \"Investigational\" means that the intervention is being studied.\n\nThe FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved GDC-0084 as a treatment for any disease.\n\nTrastuzumab is a targeted therapy approved by the FDA to be used alone or in combination with a chemotherapy drug to treat HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.\n\nGDC-0084 has been shown to stop the activity of a protein called PI3-kinase. This action blocks a pathway in the body that cancer cells commonly use to grow and divide.\n\nTrastuzumab is called a \"targeted therapy\" because it works by attaching itself to specific receptors on the surface of breast cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors. When targeted therapies attach to HER2 receptors, the signals that tell the cells to grow are blocked and the cancer cell may be marked for destruction by the immune system. This process allows trastuzumab to help slow or stop the growth of the breast cancer.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are looking to see how your cancer responds to the combination of GDC-0084 and Trastuzumab."

Such participants are eligible for immediate enrollment on this study providing that at least one untreated lesion is measurable\nParticipants who have had prior WBRT and/or SRS and then whose lesions have subsequently progressed or who have new lesions are also eligible. In this case, lesions which have been treated with SRS may be considered as target lesions if there is unequivocal evidence, in the opinion of the treating physician, of progression following SRS.\nParticipants who have not previously been treated with cranial radiation (e.g., WBRT or SRS) are eligible to enter the study, but such participants must be asymptomatic from their CNS metastases and not requiring corticosteroids for symptom control.\nParticipants who present with systemic stable/absent or progressive disease are eligible to this trial, as long as they fulfill one of the above criteria.\n\nCohort B:\n\nNew and/or progressive brain metastasis(es) with clinical indication for resection.\nAll Cohorts:\nPathologically confirmed HER2-positive MBC by local laboratory with the following requirements: HER2 overexpressed or amplified (immunohistochemistry of 3+ or HER2 gene amplification by in situ hybridization with a ratio of HER2-gene signals to centromere 17 signals \u2265 2.0 or average HER2 copy number \u2265 6.0 signals/cells).\nEastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of \u2264 2.\nLeft ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u2265 50% by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan.\nStable or decreasing corticosteroid dose for at least 7 days prior to initiation of treatment.\nConcurrent administration of other anti-cancer therapy during the course of this study is not allowed. Note that concurrent use of supportive care medications (e.g. anti-resorptive agents, pain medications) is allowed.\nThe participant is \u226518 years old.\n\nParticipants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\nAbsolute neutrophil count \u22651,000/\u03bcl\nPlatelets \u226575,000/\u03bcl\nHemoglobin \u22659 g/dL\nTotal bilirubin \u22641.5mg/dL (upper limit of normal) except subject with documented Gilbert's syndrome (\u22645 x ULN) or liver metastasis, who must have a baseline total bilirubin \u22643.0 mg/dL;\nAST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) \u2264 2.5 \u00d7 institutional ULN OR \u2264 5.0 \u00d7 institutional ULN for patients with documented liver metastases.\nSerum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dL (or glomerular filtration rate \u2265 30 ml/min as determined by the Cockcroft-Gault equation)\nFemale subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 8 days of initiating protocol therapy.\nThe effects of GDC-0084 on the developing human fetus are unknown and radiotherapy has known teratogenic effects so women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and 7 months after completion of Trastuzumab administration per recommendations from the Trastuzumab package insert.\nThe subject is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and has signed the informed consent document.\nParticipant must be able to swallow and retain oral medication.\n\nExclusion Criteria:\n\nVisceral crisis or impending visceral crisis at time of screening.\nCNS complications for whom urgent neurosurgical intervention is indicated (e.g., resection, shunt placement).\nKnown leptomeningeal metastases [Defined as positive CSF cytology and/or unequivocal radiological evidence of clinically significant leptomeningeal involvement. CSF sampling is not required in the absence of suggestive symptoms to exclude leptomeningeal involvement].\nPatients with known contraindication to MRI (e.g., due to pacemaker, ferromagnetic implants, claustrophobia, extreme obesity, hypersensitivity, etc.). However, head CT with contrast may be used in place of MRI at baseline and throughout the trial if MRI is contraindicated and a participant's brain metastases are clearly measurable by head CT.\nChemotherapy or targeted therapy within 14 days prior to initiation of protocol therapy. No washout is required for trastuzumab.\nHas received prior therapy with a PI3K or mTOR inhibitor.\nNo washout is required for endocrine therapy. If a patient has been on ovarian suppression for at least 28 days prior to initiation of study treatment, continuation of ovarian suppression is permitted on protocol. Starting a new endocrine therapy during protocol therapy is not permitted.\nCurrent use or history of receiving a non-approved, investigational treatment within 14 days prior to initiation of protocol therapy.\nSubjects with a history of hypersensitivity to compounds of similar biologic composition to GDC-0084 or any constituent of the product.\nThe subject has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, congestive heart failure-New York Heart Association Class III or IV, active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within the previous six months, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM), gastric or duodenal ulceration diagnosed within the previous 6 months, chronic liver or renal disease, or severe malnutrition. If a participant has controlled DM but is unable to monitor blood sugars at home, they will be excluded from the trial.\nThe subject is pregnant or breast-feeding.\nNo active, second potentially life-threatening cancer.\nHas had major surgery within 21 days before initiation of protocol therapy.\nActive infection requiring IV antibiotics at the time of protocol therapy initiation.\nSymptomatic intrinsic lung disease or extensive tumor involvement of the lungs, resulting in dyspnea at rest.\nKnown intolerance to trastuzumab.\nQT interval time of \u2265 470 msec.\nParticipants receiving any medications or substances that are strong inhibitors or strong inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Should a participant be taking one of these agents and is able to discontinue the therapy or switch to a different agent, no washout will be required prior to starting study medication. Please see Appendix M for the list of medications. Corticosteroids, which are weak CYP3A4 inducers are allowed. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product",
