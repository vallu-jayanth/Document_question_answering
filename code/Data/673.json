In 2018 the national cancer Institute funded the development of a decisional aid (DA) on the theme of whether or not to take part in breast cancer screening, specific to the French setting. It is the website Discutons-mammo.fr DEDICACES project 1.\n\nDEDICACES 2 is a pragmatic, non-inferiority, population-based trial with a cluster design. The aim is to assess the impact of the dispatch of a leaflet informing women of the existence of the DA Discutons-mammo.fr on the uptake by eligible women of breast cancer screening in an organised setting in usual practical conditions and in the general population"
