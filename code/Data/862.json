                "BriefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to determine if pancreatic cancer/pre-cancer can be detected in early stages through the molecular analysis of stool samples. Investigators hypothesize that analysis of stool samples using digital melt curve (DMC) analysis, can be used as a sensitive and specific method to detect the common genetic abnormalities present in pancreatic cancers and pre-cancerous lesions of the pancreas.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDC) remains the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. This is largely due to the fact that most patients present with advanced, unresectable disease, highlighting the critical need for a screening test for this disease. Stool testing is an approach that has not been explored for use in PDC screening. With the advent of stool-based DNA tests, it may be possible to target genetic abnormalities that have been recently characterized in PDC tumorigenesis.\n\nAim: The aim of this study is to determine if deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) alterations present in pancreatic cancer and precancerous intrapapillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) can be reliably recovered in matched stool.\n\nMethods: This is a case-control prospective study to determine the utility of a stool-based digital melt curve (DMC) assay in PDC screening. A total of 30 patients (18 with pancreatic cancer, 12 with IPMN) who will be undergoing pancreatic resection will be enrolled. Pancreatic neoplastic tissue will be isolated from their surgical specimens and the genes most commonly mutated in PDC will be sequenced from extracted DNA. In addition, hypermethylation at common promoter sites will be assessed by methylation-specific PCR. The genetic and epigenetic alterations isolated in pancreatic tissue will be utilized as the targets for stool DMC assay. Blinded technicians will process stool specimens from control patients as well as a matched control. The primary outcomes of this study will be the sensitivity and specificity of the stool DMC assay in detecting genetic mutations present in tumor or IPMN lesions."

Ten slices of 10 microns each from each specimen will be prepared and sent to Mayo Clinic on dry ice.\nStool Collection: Prior to any surgery, stool will be collected from both study and control patients. Collection containers and mailing materials will be provided to subjects at time of their recruitment. Stool specimens will be mailed directly to Mayo Clinic within 48 hours of collection. Stool will be stored at 80 \u00b0C until assayed.\nStool DNA extraction: After stool is homogenized, crude stool DNA will be extracted and purified.\nDigital melt curve mutation analysis: Target gene copies in captured stool DNA and tissue DNA will be quantified with real-time PCR. To target the mutations detected in tumor specimens, we will utilize PCR primers that scan for specific gene abnormalities."
