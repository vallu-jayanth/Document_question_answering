It is a treatment, named by \"focal therapy\" for \"clinically localized prostate cancer\". As this new treatment is aiming to treat only specific prostatic area of cancer, it is different from the invasive conventional treatment to remove the entire prostate gland. The goal is to achieve both to control of known cancer by treating only the cancerous area and to maintain of QOL (Quality-of-life) by leaving of the other normal prostate tissue and its surrounding organs intact resulting in prevention of urinary-leakage and sexual-dysfunction as the complications.",

However, total prostatectomy is invasive and postoperative urinary incontinence, sexual dysfunction and local recurrence remain clinical challenges even with the introduction of robotic assistance techniques. Cryotherapy has been approved as one of the other surgical treatment options for localized prostate cancer in the USA and Europe, but not in Japan. This clinical trial aims to expand the indication of cryotherapy equipment, which has already been approved for insurance for renal cancer, to prostate cancer in Japan. In this clinical trial, Focal Therapy will be performed by targeting a single localized prostate cancer lesion visualized by MRI. By targeting cancer lesions in a minimally invasive manner, we aim to achieve both control of cancer lesions and maintenance of quality of life.",
