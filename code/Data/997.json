                "BriefSummary": "China with high incidence of non-small cell lung cancer. In the past few decades, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and other treatments were continuously improved, however, the mortality of lung cancer patients was not significantly decreased. For patients with locally advanced lung cancer, direct surgery is not effective. It is difficult to achieve radical resection by surgery merely, and even if many patients receive surgery, they may eventually have tumor recurrence and poor survival rate. Therefore, it is necessary to explore effective perioperative neoadjuvant treatment to reduce the risk of postoperative recurrence and improve the postoperative survival rate of patients. According to the reports, PD-1/ PD-L1 immunocheckpoint inhibitor may become a new method for the treatment of lung cancer. Preliminary clinical results showed that immunotherapy combined with chemoradiotherapy provided a synergies antitumor effect. Multiple clinical results showed that serplulimab provided higher overall response rate for advanced lung cancer. However, in patients with locally advanced lung cancer, the efficacy of serplulimab combined with chemotherapy for sequential radical surgery is still unclear. The purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of serplulimab combined with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant therapy of resectable non-small cell lung cancer."
