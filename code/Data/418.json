The new SST-LC protocol will incorporate behavioral strategies designed to meet the needs of older adults with lung cancer, including examining individual and shared expectations for lung cancer care, identifying discrepancies between expectations and realistic possibilities, and modifying stress-exacerbating behaviors.",
