The clinical data of 200 patients were initially collected and grouped, with the study group positioned as breast cancer patients (patients with pathologically determined breast cancer) and the control group as non-breast cancer patients (patients with benign breast tumors and healthy women), to investigate the expression of CTC in breast cancer and correlation with the degree of metastasis, as well as to further understand the relationship between CTC in peripheral blood and breast cancer clinicopathology. The circulating tumor cell enrichment was compared between the two groups, and the data were derived for statistical analysis to draw conclusions, as well as to identify shortcomings and make improvements to the existing problems."
