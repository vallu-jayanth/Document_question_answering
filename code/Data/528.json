                "BriefSummary": "The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of multimedia and print tools designed to provide patients at safety-net clinics with comprehensible information about colorectal cancer screening and motivate them to complete screening.The print and multimedia interventions were constructed with parallel content to allow valid comparison of format-related effects on knowledge and screening rates.These easy to use tools will provide under served patients at community health centers with clear and consistent messages about colorectal Cancer(CRC) and CRC screening, delivered immediately before the patients see a doctor.\n\nSpecific Aims\n\nTo determine if multimedia and print interventions that provide patients with information and motivational messages about CRC screening increase screening rates above usual care.\n\nDetermine whether showing patients a multimedia program achieves higher CRC screening rates than does a print booklet with equivalent messages.\n\nExamine if the effects of these multimedia and print interventions on CRC screening rates differ with literacy level.\nExamine if the effects of these multimedia and print interventions on CRC screening differ with race/ethnicity\nExamine if these multimedia and print interventions have differential effects on knowledge relevant to CRC screening.",
                "DetailedDescription": "Despite the clear benefits of screening for early detection and prevention of colorectal cancer, as many as half of eligible adults remain unscreened. Poor and under served populations, particularly African American and Latino/Hispanic adults, are at greatest risk for noncompliance with recommended tests. Health education strategies developed to date have led to relatively minimal gains, resulting in little translation to routine clinical practice. This is especially true in more difficult, resource-strained practice settings, such as community health centers.\n\nThe interventions in the proposed study draw on communication science to optimize message design, use communication technology to optimize message delivery and include parallel content in both print and multimedia versions to allow comparison of format-related effects on both knowledge and screening rates.The multimedia and print tools are based on patient education programs that we developed with extensive attention to theory as well as community member input."
