This will be a pilot aspect of the study and data from these participants will be for descriptive purposes."

Cancer treatment late-effects affecting sleep are addressed as potential contributors to these cognitive and behavioral factors, and as symptoms that may benefit from referral for medical evaluation/management. Participants are instructed in these cognitive-behavioral strategies as a group, but using analysis of personal sleep-log data, symptom self-reports and targeted workbook exercises, they are helped to tailor the intervention to address their specific needs.",
